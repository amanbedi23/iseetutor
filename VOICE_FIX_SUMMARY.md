# Voice Interaction Fix Summary

## Issue
When tapping the mic button in the Voice Interaction screen, nothing was happening because voice processing libraries (like OpenWakeWord, PyAudio, etc.) are not included in the cloud deployment to keep the container size small.

## Solution
1. **Backend Updates** (`src/api/main.py`):
   - Modified WebSocket handler to detect when voice pipeline is not available
   - Added direct text input processing using the companion LLM
   - Returns appropriate error messages when voice is requested

2. **Frontend Updates** (`frontend/src/components/VoiceInteraction.tsx`):
   - Automatically shows text input field when voice is not available
   - Updated status messages to guide users
   - Handles voice_state messages to detect text-only mode
   - Passes mode and user context with text messages

## How It Works Now

### Voice Interaction Screen:
1. When you go to Voice Interaction, it will automatically show a text input field
2. The status will show "Type your message below"
3. You can type messages and press Enter to chat
4. The AI will respond based on the selected mode (Tutor/Friend/Hybrid)

### Alternative: Text Chat Screen
For a better text-based experience, use the dedicated Text Chat:
1. From the home screen, click "ðŸ’¬ Text Chat"
2. This provides a full chat interface optimized for text

## Technical Details

### Voice Not Available Because:
- Cloud deployment doesn't include audio processing libraries
- Libraries like PyAudio, sounddevice, webrtcvad are commented out in requirements-cloud.txt
- This keeps the Docker image smaller and avoids complex audio dependencies

### Future Voice Support:
To add voice support in the cloud, we would need to:
1. Integrate Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for speech recognition
2. Integrate Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for responses
3. Use Picovoice for wake word detection ("Hey Tutor")
4. Handle audio streaming from the browser using WebRTC

## Testing the Fix

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Start Voice Learning"
3. You'll see the text input field automatically appear
4. Type a message and press Enter
5. The AI will respond based on your selected mode

Or use the Text Chat:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "ðŸ’¬ Text Chat"
3. Start chatting with the AI companion
