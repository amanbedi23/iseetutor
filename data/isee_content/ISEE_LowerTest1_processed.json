Born in 1941 in Tacoma, Washington,\n4he was \u0000rst introduced to glass as a medium\n5while studying interior design at the\n6University of Washington. He then went on\n7to study in the \u0000rst glass program in the\n8country at the Rhode Island School of\n9Design. However, his work as a glass artist\n10was most de\u0000ned by the techniques he\n11learned during his time working at the\n12Venini glass factory in Venice, Italy.\n13      Over the past 700 years, Venetians\n14have perfected the art of glassblowing.\n15In fact, Chihuly was the \u0000rst American to\n16of\u0000cially study alongside these artisans of\n17their craft. During his time there, he\n18learned techniques that had long been\n19secrets to artists elsewhere and virtually\n20unknown to American artists.\n21      One of the most important skills that he\n22learned in Venice was the team approach\n23to glassblowing. Glassblowing was often\n24physically demanding and dangerous,25and required more than one person to do\n26well. Team approaches to glassblowing\n27enabled artists to make large and\n28complicated glass sculptures, which would\n29not be possible if done alone.\n30      I had the opportunity to see Chihuly’s\n31sculptures in person by visiting his\n32permanent exhibit, Chihuly Garden and\n33Glass, in Seattle, Washington. I didn't know\n34what to expect, but as soon as I entered, I\n35was enthralled by the glowing colors,\n36supernatural shapes, and larger-than-life\n37installations. Many of his sculptures were\n38neon snake-like forms and multi-colored\n39globes sitting atop black glass \u0000oors. They\n40resembled glowing sea creatures emerging\n41from the depths of the sea. There was a\n42beauty to the way that the artist blended\n43natural shapes and supernatural colors. It\n44was like nothing I had experienced before,\n45and I quickly understood why Chihuly had\n46become so well-regarded in his \u0000eld and\n47an inspiration to countless others.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 26 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #1 v11.0 - RC\n1.  The primary purpose of this passage is to\n(A)   offer the history of the art of glass-\nblowing.\n(B)   compare an artist’s style with those of\npast artists.\n(C)   critique the works of other glass-\nblowing artists.\n(D)   tell the life story of an artist and\nexpress admiration for his art.\n2.  Which best describes the author's tone in\nthe last paragraph (lines 30–47)?\n(A)   curious\n(B)   direct\n(C)   hesitant\n(D)   inspired\n3.  The imagery that the author uses to\ndescribe Chihuly’s artwork includes which\nof the following descriptions?\n(A)   frightening\n(B)   lifeless\n(C)   shining\n(D)   squid-like\n4.  According to the author, one of the most\nimportant skills Chihuly learned was that of\n(A)   reverse \u0000ow.\n(B)   re\u0000ning glass.\n(C)   working in teams.\n(D)   air bubble encapsulation.5.  After studying interior design, Dale\nChihuly's experience included which of the\nfollowing?\n(A)   training at the Eugene Academy\n(B)   working at the Paris glass factory\n(C)   studying at the University of Michigan\n(D)   taking classes at the Rhode Island\nSchool of Design\n© 2025 Test Innovators 27 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #1 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 6-10\n1      Science begins with exploration and\n2wonder. You may wonder about anything,\n3but in order to be scienti\u0000cally veri\u0000able,\n4your question must be testable. You may\n5wonder how high a grasshopper can hop, for\n6example. You will need to think clearly\n7about the question you are asking. To\n8answer this question in a scienti\u0000c way, you\n9design experiments: ways that you can test\n10the height of a grasshopper’s jump. You will\n11have to think about all aspects of the\n12experiment: how to keep the grasshopper\n13from hopping away, how to measure the\n14height of the jumps, and how to get the\n15grasshopper to jump. Additionally, you will\n16need to ensure that each time you use the\n17same method to get the grasshopper to jump.\n18      As you perform experiments, you will\n19record your observations, including the\n20height of each jump. You will need to\n21decide how many times the grasshopper\n22must jump in order to get a true measure of\n23the grasshopper’s jumping ability. It is\n24unlikely each jump will be exactly\n25the same, which you will need to explain in26your conclusions. Why might the\n27grasshopper jump different heights with\n28different jumps? Are the \u0000rst few jumps\n29higher than the last few? How many times\n30will you make a single grasshopper jump?\n31How much rest will you allow between\n32jumps? How many grasshoppers will you\n33use?\n34      Finally, you will share your observations\n35and conclusions with other scientists.\n36Scientists write reports and publish them in\n37journals so everyone can learn about their\n38experiments and conclusions. In order to\n39make a sound scienti\u0000c statement, other\n40scientists must be able to repeat your\n41experiment and come to the same\n42conclusions. You will have to explain\n43exactly how you did everything so others\n44can try your experimental design and see if\n45they get the same results. This last step is\n46called reproducibility. If other scientists can\n47reproduce the research, we can be more\n48con\u0000dent that its conclusions are correct.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #1 v11.0 - RC\n6.  The main purpose of this passage is to\n(A)   explain how grasshoppers jump.\n(B)   explain how science is conducted.\n(C)   describe how to prove something.\n(D)   contrast observation and conclusion.\n7.  In the second paragraph (lines 18-33), the\nauthor describes\n(A)   research that a scientist might need to\nread.\n(B)   evidence that a scientist might need to\ndisprove.\n(C)   questions that a scientist might need\nto explain.\n(D)   grasshopper species that a scientist\nmight need to record.\n8.  According to the passage, why do scientists\nshare how they designed their experiments\nwith other scientists?\n(A)   to prove to other scientists how\ncareful they were\n(B)   to demonstrate what effective\nexperiments should look like\n(C)   so other scientists can reproduce their\nresearch to prove it wrong\n(D)   so other scientists can perform the\nsame experiments to see if they get\nthe same results9.  In line 3, “scienti\u0000cally veri\u0000able” most\nnearly means\n(A)   unable to be proven wrong.\n(B)   able to be veri\u0000ed through\npublication.\n(C)   able to be tested through observation.\n(D)   unable to be checked against prior\nhuman knowledge.\n10. The function of the third paragraph (lines\n34-48) is to\n(A)   summarize the author’s argument.\n(B)   use logic to argue for the importance\nof careful observation.\n(C)   explain why scientists must share the\nresults of their experiments.\n(D)   discuss alternative methods to\neffectively conduct scienti\u0000c\nexperiments.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 29 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #1 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 11-15\n1      Anna’s hummingbird, a green jewel of\n2a bird, was named in 1929 after a French\n3duchess. This miraculous creature weighs\n4less than a nickel and has a heart that beats\n51,260 times per minute (compared to an\n6average human resting heart rate of about\n760-100 beats). A cold night can cause this\n8tiny bird to lose 16 percent of its body\n9weight as it burns its fat to avoid freezing.\n10Such a weight loss would be like a 100-pound\n11person waking up 16 pounds lighter! Despite\n12these challenges, Anna’s hummingbirds now\n13linger in western Washington State all\n14winter long, enduring cold rain, snow, and\n15nighttime temperatures of 0° to 5° Celsius\n16(about 30° to 40° Fahrenheit). This\n17incredible story of survival in the Paci\u0000c\n18Northwest is relatively recent.\n19      In North America, not until the 1930s did\n20Anna’s hummingbird spend the winters\n21any farther norththan San Francisco, California,\n22where winter temperatures remain a balmy 7°23to 15° Celsius (45° to 60° Fahrenheit). The\n24extension northward of these birds' winter range\n25is due to environmental changes and their\n26ability to adapt. Urban development\n27has replaced evergreen forests with lush,\n28diverse \u0000ower gardens in people’s yards,\n29ideal for these birds whose main source of\n30energy is \u0000ower nectar. Another form of\n31sustenance comes from nectar feeders full\n32of sugary syrup that many urban residents\n33enjoy hanging for hummingbirds.\n34      Add to these environmental changes the\n35bird’s adaptability. According to wildlife\n36ecologist Gregory A. Green, to survive cold\n37nights, a hummingbird can enter a kind of\n38hibernation or torpor, dropping its body\n39temperature from about 40°C to about 9°C\n40(from 104°F to 48.2°F) and reduce its\n41respiration rate from 245 breaths per minute\n42to 6.

There\n5have been rumors of an animal living in the\n6lake for several hundred years, with “monster”\n7sightings \u0000rst occurring in the 16th century.\n8The \u0000rst documented description of Nessie\n9occurred in October 1871, when a group of\n10people described seeing a huge creature with a\n11hump swim away very quickly.\n12      Then, on May 2, 1933, the newspaper\n13Inverness Courier ran an article about a local\n14couple who had spotted “an enormous animal\n15rolling and plunging” on the lake. The editors\n16of the paper named the creature the Loch Ness\n17monster. The story became famous\n18immediately, and a circus even offered a\n19bounty to anyone who could capture the\n20monster.\n21      The sightings and rumors continued over\n22the next several decades. In the 1990s, a\n23documentary \u0000lm crew recorded footage for\n24months, trying to disprove Nessie's existence.\n25They found no recorded evidence of the\n26monster. Strangely, however, their sonar27equipment, which had been brought to\n28disprove the existence of Nessie, revealed\n29evidence of a large body moving at the\n30deepest part of the lake. The scientists\n31involved admitted they had no idea what\n32could be in the lake but agreed that it was\n33clear that something was there. One scientist\n34even stated in the documentary that, although\n35he had started off believing that the lake was\n36empty, in the end he thought there must be\n37some animal lurking in the lake's depths.\n38Whatever kind of creature it was, it never\n39showed itself, and the \u0000lm crew left with no\n40proof.\n41      Whether or not Nessie does actually exist,\n42the legend of the Loch Ness monster has\n43changed the lives of the people who live\n44around the lake. Hotels, tours, and gift shops\n45all depend on the tourists who come to the\n46lake hoping to catch a glimpse of Nessie. With\n47so many people depending on these rumors to\n48make a living, it's unlikely the legend of the\n49Loch Ness monster will go away any time\n50soon.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #1 v11.0 - RC\n16. The primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   retell a popular myth.\n(B)   prove the existence of a mysterious\ncreature.\n(C)   doubt people who believe in the Loch\nNess monster.\n(D)   provide the context and background\nof a popular legend.\n17. Which phrase best describes the tone of the\npassage?\n(A)   factual\n(B)   relaxed\n(C)   astonished\n(D)   encouraging\n18. According to the passage,\n(A)   the Loch Ness monster is believed to\nbe less than 100 years old.\n(B)   many tourists visit the lake, hoping to\nspot the Loch Ness Monster.\n(C)   the \u0000rst documented description of\nthe Loch Ness monster occurred in\n1933.\n(D)   no one has tried to disprove the\nexistence of the Loch Ness monster.19. The passage implies that\n(A)   the Loch Ness monster is the last\nliving dinosaur.\n(B)   the \u0000lm crew was unable to \u0000nish\ntheir documentary.\n(C)   all of the local residents believe in the\nLoch Ness monster.\n(D)   sonar equipment can be used to locate\nobjects underwater.\n20. In line 37, the word \"lurking\" most nearly\nmeans\n(A)   hiding.\n(B)   living.\n(C)   swimming.\n(D)   watching.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 33 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #1 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1      “Autocorrection” or “text replacement”\n2is a text editing feature commonly found on\n3modern text messaging devices like iPhones\n4and smartphones and in word processing\n5programs on computers. If you ever send\n6text messages or use a word processor such\n7as Microsoft Word, then you may have\n8encountered this feature when you misspell\n9a word and the computer automatically\n10corrects the misspelled word for you.\n11      Autocorrection is a fantastic feature in\n12modern technology that helps us compose\n13messages more ef\u0000ciently by correcting\n14little errors along the way. It also helps the\n15recipient read our messages with ease.\n16However, autocorrection is not a new\n17phenomenon. In fact, your brain performs\n18this very same task all the time without you\n19even realizing it. Try reading the following\n20sentence, for example: Tihs is a smaple\n21snetecne to tset yuor brian’s abiltiy to\n22corrcet mitskaes.23      Many people are surprised to discover\n24that they can understand the previous\n25sentence with relative ease, even though the\n26letters are scrambled. Scientists believe that\n27our brain’s ability to make sense out of\n28misspelled words like this stems from the\n29fact that as we become more \u0000uent and\n30pro\u0000cient readers we stop reading words one\n31letter at a time. Instead, we quickly scan\n32several words in a sentence by extracting\n33information from the context.\n34      Much of your ability to understand the\n35scrambled sentence, for example, is because\n36the \u0000rst and last letter of each word is in the\n37correct place. Whether you notice this or\n38not, your brain picks this up and then\n39combines that information with other key\n40indicators, like letter combinations and\n41sounds. These elements make it easier to\n42infer the word even when the letters are not\n43in perfect order.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #1 v11.0 - RC\n21. What does the passage mainly discuss?\n(A)   the brain’s ability to make sense of\nwords through practice\n(B)   how autocorrection functions in word\nprocessors and text messaging devices\n(C)   how words only make sense if the \u0000rst\nand last letter is in the correct place\n(D)   the similarity between a computer’s\nability to correct misspelled words\nand your brain’s ability to read them\n22. It can be inferred from the passage that\nmuch of the brain’s ability to process\ninformation is\n(A)   calculated.\n(B)   instinctive.\n(C)   threatening.\n(D)   unnatural.\n23. According to the passage, which of the\nfollowing is true?\n(A)   Autocorrection is a new phenomenon.\n(B)   Autocorrection makes it dif\u0000cult for\nrecipients to read text messages\ncorrectly.\n(C)   Brains can only make sense of\nscrambled words when the \u0000rst and\nlast letters are misplaced.\n(D)   By gathering contextual information,\nour brains make sense of several\nwords in a sentence at once.24. In line 13, “ef\u0000ciently” most nearly means\n(A)   absently.\n(B)   carelessly.\n(C)   daintily.\n(D)   productively.\n25. In line 28, “stems” most nearly means\n(A)   causes.\n(B)   develops.\n(C)   helps.\n(D)   removes.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 35 STOP.

      "text": "Lower #1 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 1-5\n1      Dale Chihuly has become one of the\n2most well-known blown-glass artists of our\n3time. Born in 1941 in Tacoma, Washington,\n4he was \u0000rst introduced to glass as a medium\n5while studying interior design at the\n6University of Washington. He then went on\n7to study in the \u0000rst glass program in the\n8country at the Rhode Island School of\n9Design. However, his work as a glass artist\n10was most de\u0000ned by the techniques he\n11learned during his time working at the\n12Venini glass factory in Venice, Italy.\n13      Over the past 700 years, Venetians\n14have perfected the art of glassblowing.\n15In fact, Chihuly was the \u0000rst American to\n16of\u0000cially study alongside these artisans of\n17their craft. During his time there, he\n18learned techniques that had long been\n19secrets to artists elsewhere and virtually\n20unknown to American artists.\n21      One of the most important skills that he\n22learned in Venice was the team approach\n23to glassblowing. Glassblowing was often\n24physically demanding and dangerous,25and required more than one person to do\n26well. Team approaches to glassblowing\n27enabled artists to make large and\n28complicated glass sculptures, which would\n29not be possible if done alone.\n30      I had the opportunity to see Chihuly’s\n31sculptures in person by visiting his\n32permanent exhibit, Chihuly Garden and\n33Glass, in Seattle, Washington. I didn't know\n34what to expect, but as soon as I entered, I\n35was enthralled by the glowing colors,\n36supernatural shapes, and larger-than-life\n37installations. Many of his sculptures were\n38neon snake-like forms and multi-colored\n39globes sitting atop black glass \u0000oors. They\n40resembled glowing sea creatures emerging\n41from the depths of the sea. There was a\n42beauty to the way that the artist blended\n43natural shapes and supernatural colors. It\n44was like nothing I had experienced before,\n45and I quickly understood why Chihuly had\n46become so well-regarded in his \u0000eld and\n47an inspiration to countless others.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 26 Go on to the next page. ",

You may wonder about anything,\n3but in order to be scienti\u0000cally veri\u0000able,\n4your question must be testable. You may\n5wonder how high a grasshopper can hop, for\n6example. You will need to think clearly\n7about the question you are asking. To\n8answer this question in a scienti\u0000c way, you\n9design experiments: ways that you can test\n10the height of a grasshopper’s jump. You will\n11have to think about all aspects of the\n12experiment: how to keep the grasshopper\n13from hopping away, how to measure the\n14height of the jumps, and how to get the\n15grasshopper to jump. Additionally, you will\n16need to ensure that each time you use the\n17same method to get the grasshopper to jump.\n18      As you perform experiments, you will\n19record your observations, including the\n20height of each jump. You will need to\n21decide how many times the grasshopper\n22must jump in order to get a true measure of\n23the grasshopper’s jumping ability. It is\n24unlikely each jump will be exactly\n25the same, which you will need to explain in26your conclusions. Why might the\n27grasshopper jump different heights with\n28different jumps? Are the \u0000rst few jumps\n29higher than the last few? How many times\n30will you make a single grasshopper jump?\n31How much rest will you allow between\n32jumps? How many grasshoppers will you\n33use?\n34      Finally, you will share your observations\n35and conclusions with other scientists.\n36Scientists write reports and publish them in\n37journals so everyone can learn about their\n38experiments and conclusions. In order to\n39make a sound scienti\u0000c statement, other\n40scientists must be able to repeat your\n41experiment and come to the same\n42conclusions. You will have to explain\n43exactly how you did everything so others\n44can try your experimental design and see if\n45they get the same results. This last step is\n46called reproducibility. If other scientists can\n47reproduce the research, we can be more\n48con\u0000dent that its conclusions are correct.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. ",

This miraculous creature weighs\n4less than a nickel and has a heart that beats\n51,260 times per minute (compared to an\n6average human resting heart rate of about\n760-100 beats). A cold night can cause this\n8tiny bird to lose 16 percent of its body\n9weight as it burns its fat to avoid freezing.\n10Such a weight loss would be like a 100-pound\n11person waking up 16 pounds lighter! Despite\n12these challenges, Anna’s hummingbirds now\n13linger in western Washington State all\n14winter long, enduring cold rain, snow, and\n15nighttime temperatures of 0° to 5° Celsius\n16(about 30° to 40° Fahrenheit). This\n17incredible story of survival in the Paci\u0000c\n18Northwest is relatively recent.\n19      In North America, not until the 1930s did\n20Anna’s hummingbird spend the winters\n21any farther norththan San Francisco, California,\n22where winter temperatures remain a balmy 7°23to 15° Celsius (45° to 60° Fahrenheit). The\n24extension northward of these birds' winter range\n25is due to environmental changes and their\n26ability to adapt. Urban development\n27has replaced evergreen forests with lush,\n28diverse \u0000ower gardens in people’s yards,\n29ideal for these birds whose main source of\n30energy is \u0000ower nectar. Another form of\n31sustenance comes from nectar feeders full\n32of sugary syrup that many urban residents\n33enjoy hanging for hummingbirds.\n34      Add to these environmental changes the\n35bird’s adaptability. According to wildlife\n36ecologist Gregory A. Green, to survive cold\n37nights, a hummingbird can enter a kind of\n38hibernation or torpor, dropping its body\n39temperature from about 40°C to about 9°C\n40(from 104°F to 48.2°F) and reduce its\n41respiration rate from 245 breaths per minute\n42to 6. It can even suspend its breathing for up\n43to \u0000ve minutes.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #1 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1      The Loch Ness monster, nicknamed\n2“Nessie,” is a mysterious, dinosaur-like\n3creature that many people believe lives in Loch\n4Ness, a lake in the Scottish highlands. There\n5have been rumors of an animal living in the\n6lake for several hundred years, with “monster”\n7sightings \u0000rst occurring in the 16th century.\n8The \u0000rst documented description of Nessie\n9occurred in October 1871, when a group of\n10people described seeing a huge creature with a\n11hump swim away very quickly.\n12      Then, on May 2, 1933, the newspaper\n13Inverness Courier ran an article about a local\n14couple who had spotted “an enormous animal\n15rolling and plunging” on the lake. The editors\n16of the paper named the creature the Loch Ness\n17monster. The story became famous\n18immediately, and a circus even offered a\n19bounty to anyone who could capture the\n20monster.\n21      The sightings and rumors continued over\n22the next several decades. In the 1990s, a\n23documentary \u0000lm crew recorded footage for\n24months, trying to disprove Nessie's existence.\n25They found no recorded evidence of the\n26monster. Strangely, however, their sonar27equipment, which had been brought to\n28disprove the existence of Nessie, revealed\n29evidence of a large body moving at the\n30deepest part of the lake. The scientists\n31involved admitted they had no idea what\n32could be in the lake but agreed that it was\n33clear that something was there. One scientist\n34even stated in the documentary that, although\n35he had started off believing that the lake was\n36empty, in the end he thought there must be\n37some animal lurking in the lake's depths.\n38Whatever kind of creature it was, it never\n39showed itself, and the \u0000lm crew left with no\n40proof.\n41      Whether or not Nessie does actually exist,\n42the legend of the Loch Ness monster has\n43changed the lives of the people who live\n44around the lake. Hotels, tours, and gift shops\n45all depend on the tourists who come to the\n46lake hoping to catch a glimpse of Nessie. With\n47so many people depending on these rumors to\n48make a living, it's unlikely the legend of the\n49Loch Ness monster will go away any time\n50soon.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #1 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1      “Autocorrection” or “text replacement”\n2is a text editing feature commonly found on\n3modern text messaging devices like iPhones\n4and smartphones and in word processing\n5programs on computers. If you ever send\n6text messages or use a word processor such\n7as Microsoft Word, then you may have\n8encountered this feature when you misspell\n9a word and the computer automatically\n10corrects the misspelled word for you.\n11      Autocorrection is a fantastic feature in\n12modern technology that helps us compose\n13messages more ef\u0000ciently by correcting\n14little errors along the way. It also helps the\n15recipient read our messages with ease.\n16However, autocorrection is not a new\n17phenomenon. In fact, your brain performs\n18this very same task all the time without you\n19even realizing it. Try reading the following\n20sentence, for example: Tihs is a smaple\n21snetecne to tset yuor brian’s abiltiy to\n22corrcet mitskaes.23      Many people are surprised to discover\n24that they can understand the previous\n25sentence with relative ease, even though the\n26letters are scrambled. Scientists believe that\n27our brain’s ability to make sense out of\n28misspelled words like this stems from the\n29fact that as we become more \u0000uent and\n30pro\u0000cient readers we stop reading words one\n31letter at a time. Instead, we quickly scan\n32several words in a sentence by extracting\n33information from the context.\n34      Much of your ability to understand the\n35scrambled sentence, for example, is because\n36the \u0000rst and last letter of each word is in the\n37correct place. Whether you notice this or\n38not, your brain picks this up and then\n39combines that information with other key\n40indicators, like letter combinations and\n41sounds. These elements make it easier to\n42infer the word even when the letters are not\n43in perfect order.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. ",
