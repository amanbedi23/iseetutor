Mendeleev’s mother\n6 saw his potential from an early age. A\n7 year after his father’s death, when he\n8 was fourteen and all of his siblings had\n9 moved away, Mendeleev and his mother\n10 left home to get him into a university.\n11 After being rejected multiple times,\n12 Mendeleev was eventually accepted to\n13 the same university as his father, who\n14 had been an accomplished chemist.\n15 But the 1,600 mile journey to get to\n16 Mendeleev's new university was dif\u0000cult.\n17 Tragically, Mendeleev's mother passed\n18 away shortly after they arrived to\n19 St. Petersburg.\n20       Working in laboratories all day,\n21 Mendeleev began seeing relationships\n22 between elements and started work on a\n23 table to organize the sixty or so that were24 known at the time. The obvious schema\n25 was to organize the emerging table by\n26 atomic weight, but Mendeleev saw that\n27 the most signi\u0000cant relationship between\n28 the elements had nothing to do with\n29 atomic weight, but rather reactivity,\n30 characteristics that were believed to\n31 repeat every seven elements (it is now\n32 known to repeat every eight, which\n33 accounts for the nonreactive noble gases\n34 that hadn’t yet been discovered).\n35 Unfortunately, as the masses of the\n36 elements increased, their relationship\n37 began to look less periodic. Mendeleev\n38 toiled over the table and eventually\n39 realized that the table didn’t work\n40 because there were elements that hadn’t\n41 yet been discovered. He inserted gaps\n42 where the unidenti\u0000ed elements would\n43 be, even accurately predicting the\n44 properties of the missing elements.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\n1.  Mendeleev’s table is called the Periodic\nTable of the Elements.

Hà had\n4 been working as a software consultant when her\n5 vision began to deteriorate. Hà learned that she\n6 suffers from an autoimmune disorder called\n7 neuromyelitis optica, which leads to severely\n8 impaired vision.\n9       As her vision gradually failed, she left her\n10 job and went back to graduate school to get a\n11 degree in creative writing. At the same time,\n12 she pursued her passion for cooking as a\n13 self-taught chef. She began by teaching herself\n14 to make her late mother’s egg roll recipe, using\n15 touch and sound to guide her process. She\n16 learned to listen for the hot oil to spatter\n17 against the pan, and to use her hands to test the\n18 crispiness of the fried shells.\n19       W hile learning to cook with only four senses\n20 was certainly arduous, Hà believes that\n21 using limited senses taught her to pay close\n22 attention to details in her dishes. For example,\n23 while chefs with vision may focus on speed\n24 when cutting vegetables, Hà is very careful\n25 when using her knives, focusing on cutting\n26 precisely. W hen she has \u0000nished a dish, she uses\n27 her hands to create an intricate,\n28 beautifully-constructed plate of food, based off\n29 the design in her mind. As she puts it, “it’s like\n30 my \u0000ngertips have become my eyes. I can learn\n31 so much more by touch than I would have\n32 thought.”\n33       As a visually-impaired chef, Hà has trained34 each of her other four senses to be very sensitive\n35 to her environment. Now, she is able to listen to\n36 several different conversations happening\n37 simultaneously. Additionally, and most\n38 importantly, her sense of taste and smell have\n39 heightened: she can distinguish between\n40 different tastes and scents faster than other\n41 people.\n42       Hà’s perseverance and dedication to the\n43 culinary arts eventually led her to compete on\n44 Masterchef, a show known for its intense\n45 cooking challenges. She auditioned on a whim,\n46 during her last semester of graduate school, and\n47 was surprised to not be eliminated in the \u0000rst\n48 week. In fact, she stayed in the competition until\n49 the end, impressing the judges with her\n50 detail-oriented and delicate dishes.\n51       After becoming the \u0000rst blind contestant to\n52 win the competition, Hà went on to host a\n53 cooking show called “Four Senses,” which was\n54 geared toward visually-impaired viewers, and to\n55 open a Vietnamese gastropub called The Blind\n56 Goat. Pursuing her love for writing, she also\n57 published a cookbook and is at work on a\n58 memoir about her experiences.\n59       Hà’s many accomplishments speak to the\n60 power of adapting and persevering through hard\n61 times. As she has stated, “Everyone in this\n62 world is dealt a different hand—some better,\n63 some worse than others—but what's more\n64 important is how you play that hand.”\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\n6.  The author implies that Christine Hà\n(A)   is better at cooking than at business.\n(B)   feels most proud of winning\nMasterchef.\n(C)   did not receive formal training in the\nculinary arts.\n(D)   is committed to \u0000ghting for equal\nrights for people with disabilities.\n7.  W hat is the tone of the last two sentences?\n(A)   divisive\n(B)   educational\n(C)   inspirational\n(D)   questioning\n8.  W hat does the word “simultaneously” most\nnearly mean in line 37?\n(A)   with ease\n(B)   in harmony\n(C)   at the same time\n(D)   outside the room\n9.  In the second paragraph, the author uses\n(A)   examples to illustrate a point.\n(B)   logic to arrive at a conclusion.\n(C)   comparison to present two ideas.\n(D)   metaphors to describe a sensation.10.  According to the passage, Christine Hà’s\n(A)   vision loss occurred in her childhood.\n(B)   sense of touch has been impaired by\nher vision loss.\n(C)   vision loss led to her elimination from\nMasterchef.\n(D)   sense of hearing became more\nsensitive after her vision loss.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 31 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 11-15\n1       W hile most of us tend to read silently\n2 with our eyes and mind, many people love\n3 to read poetry out loud. The musical sound\n4 of poems makes reading them aloud an\n5 enjoyable experience. This is why, for much\n6 of history, poetry written in English has used\n7 rhythm and rhyme.\n8       One conventional form of poetry that\n9 follows a particular kind of rhythm and rhyme\n10 scheme is the sonnet. Taking its name from\n11 the Italian word sonetto, which means “little\n12 song,” sonnets are short, 14-line poems\n13 written in a rhythm called iambic pentameter.\n14       The rhythm of iambic pentameter is\n15 measured with small groups of syllables\n16 called “feet.” The word “iambic” describes\n17 the type of foot that is used: one unstressed\n18 syllable followed by one stressed syllable. In\n19 English, the words “unite” and “provide” are20 both pronounced using the iambic rhythm.\n21 The word “pentameter” tells us how many\n22 iambic feet occur in each line (“penta”\n23 comes from Latin and means “\u0000ve”).\n24       W hile this may seem confusing, an easy\n25 way to think about how iambic pentameter\n26 rhythm is organized is to imagine the sound\n27 of a human heartbeat repeated \u0000ve times:\n28 da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-\n29 DUM.\n30       Now, imagine humming this rhythm\n31 along to the sounds of the words in the\n32 following sentence: “In metric verse the\n33 meter keeps the beat.” The opening line of\n34 Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 12” provides another\n35 good example of the da-DUM rhythm of the\n36 iambic pentameter: “W hen I do count the\n37 clock that tells the time.”\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\n11.  W hat does the passage mainly discuss?\n(A)   how English sonnets got their name\n(B)   the type of meter used in traditional\nsonnets\n(C)   the importance of reading poetry out\nloud\n(D)   how words in poetry sound like a\nhuman heartbeat\n12.  It can be inferred from the passage that\n(A)   Shakespeare invented the sonnet\nform.\n(B)   the sonnet form likely originated in\nItaly.\n(C)   sonnets can only be written in English.\n(D)   most sonnets are not composed in\niambic pentameter.\n13.  W hat is the function of the fourth\nparagraph (lines 25–30)?\n(A)   to explain the origins of the word\n“pentameter”\n(B)   to describe the rhythm of iambic\npentameter\n(C)   to explain the rhyme scheme found in\nsonnets\n(D)   to describe poems that do not follow\nthe meter used in sonnets\n14.  In line 8, “conventional” most nearly means\n(A)   different.\n(B)   enjoyable.\n(C)   noticeable.\n(D)   traditional.15.  The word “scheme” in line 10 most nearly\nmeans\n(A)   \u0000t.\n(B)   pattern.\n(C)   range.\n(D)   sound.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 33 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1       From the time of its discovery in 1930\n2 until 2006, Pluto was classi\u0000ed as our ninth\n3 planet. Beginning in the late 1970s, this\n4 classi\u0000cation fell under increasing scrutiny\n5 as scientists debated whether Pluto met the\n6 de\u0000nition of a planet or should be\n7 reclassi\u0000ed. Over the years, astronomers\n8 discovered an increasing number of celestial\n9 objects similar to Pluto in our outer solar\n10 system including one particular object, Eris,\n11 with a mass 27% larger than Pluto’s.\n12       Located anywhere between\n13 4,437,000,000 and 7,311,000,000 km from\n14 the Sun, Pluto’s elliptical orbit is far larger\n15 than that of the other planets. It takes\n16 approximately 248 Earth years for Pluto to\n17 complete one orbit around the Sun. Due to\n18 its small mass, the planet’s motion is easily\n19 in\u0000uenced by other objects in the solar\n20 system causing Pluto’s orbit to be relatively\n21 chaotic.\n22       Pluto’s mass, determined by its effect on\n23 the orbits of other planets, was originally\n24 calculated as similar to that of Earth.\n25 However, later estimations decreased until\n26 the University of Hawaii’s observations in\n27 1976 showed that Pluto was no more than\n28 1% the mass of Earth. Pluto’s actual mass,\n29 determined in 1978, is about 0.2% of\n30 Earth’s.\n31       The most recent calculations show Pluto\n32 to be exceptionally tiny in contrast to the\n33 other planets of our solar system. Pluto’s\n34 diameter is only 66% that of the Moon.35 W hile Pluto is more than twice the diameter\n36 of Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid\n37 belt, it is smaller than several moons of\n38 other planets, including Titan, Io, Europa,\n39 and Triton. Pluto is also less massive than\n40 Eris, a trans-Neptunian object discovered in\n41 2005. Due to the observational distance,\n42 scientists cannot be positive which of the\n43 two has a larger diameter. Pluto is so small\n44 that its orbit is affected by one of its own\n45 moons, Charon, leading some scientists to\n46 call Pluto and Charon a dwarf double planet.\n47       With such a small mass, Pluto’s\n48 designation as a planet became quite\n49 controversial. Just as Ceres, Juno, Vesta, and\n50 Pallas (all objects in the asteroid belt) lost\n51 their planet status as astronomers discovered\n52 more asteroids, it was argued that Pluto also\n53 required reclassi\u0000cation. W hen Eris was\n54 discovered in 2005, its discoverers hailed it\n55 as the tenth planet since its mass was similar\n56 to that of Pluto. The astronomy community\n57 viewed this as the strongest argument for\n58 reclassifying Pluto as a dwarf planet. The\n59 debate came to a head with a 2006\n60 resolution by the International Astronomical\n61 Union that of\u0000cially de\u0000ned the term\n62 “planet.” Due to Pluto’s mass, it did not\n63 meet the quali\u0000cations. Pluto was of\u0000cially\n64 reclassi\u0000ed as a dwarf planet, a decision met\n65 with mixed resistance and approval in the\n66 astronomy community.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\n16.  A central purpose of the passage is to\nexplain\n(A)   when Pluto was discovered.\n(B)   how small Pluto is now known to be.\n(C)   how long it takes Pluto to orbit the\nSun.\n(D)   why Pluto was reclassi\u0000ed as a dwarf\nplanet.\n17.  According to the passage, what is the\nof\u0000cial reason Pluto was renamed a dwarf\nplanet?\n(A)   Its mass has diminished over time.\n(B)   It orbits at too great a distance from\nthe Sun.\n(C)   It is larger than other objects in the\nasteroid belt.\n(D)   It is too small compared to other\nobjects in our solar system.\n18.  W hich word best describes the author’s\ntone when describing Pluto’s\nreclassi\u0000cation?\n(A)   curious\n(B)   factual\n(C)   forlorn\n(D)   worried19.  The passage provides information to\nsupport which statement?\n(A)   Orbital paths are an important part of\nplanet classi\u0000cation.\n(B)   Pluto is not much smaller than some\nof the other planets.\n(C)   Not all objects that orbit the Sun are\nclassi\u0000ed as planets.\n(D)   Small masses like Pluto and Eris\nshould be classi\u0000ed as planets.\n20.  In line 21, “chaotic” most nearly means\n(A)   distant.\n(B)   enormous.\n(C)   studied.\n(D)   unstable.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 35 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       Although crows are criticized for\n2 being noisy or destructive, many people \u0000nd\n3 them engaging and delightful. In fact,\n4 numerous people report receiving gifts from\n5 crows. These include shiny and colorful\n6 objects such as screws, nails, coins, colored\n7 beads, bits of string, and even a candy heart\n8 and a prize from a cereal box. People have\n9 also received pleasing natural objects such\n10 as feathers, pretty stones, twigs, and \u0000owers,\n11 as well as the less welcome gifts of dead\n12 mice, a rotting crab claw, or a frog’s leg.\n13        John Marzluff is a professor of wildlife\n14 science who studies crows. Like all\n15 scientists, he is cautious about interpreting\n16 behavior; scientists try to avoid rushing to\n17 conclusions about what an action—human\n18 or animal—might mean. Marzluff has tried\n19 to \u0000gure out if crows have given these\n20 objects to people intentionally or by\n21 accident. As is true of all science, careful22 observation is the path to understanding.\n23        W ho receives these gifts? Usually it is\n24 people who feed the crows or who have\n25 done a crow a kindness. How do these crows\n26 deposit their gifts? They leave them at the\n27 site where they received the food or where\n28 the kind act occurred. Could all these gift-\n29 giving crows be pets who have escaped? No,\n30 in fact, wild crows give each other gifts\n31 during courtship or to repay debts.\n32        Although these and other observations\n33 are consistent with crow gift-giving as\n34 intentional, Professor Marzluff has been\n35 unable to rule out the possibility that it only\n36 seems intentional, but may really lack a\n37 gifting purpose. He looks forward to more\n38 accounts from gift recipients or to careful\n39 scienti\u0000c experiments to answer this\n40 question.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 36 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #2 v11.0 - RC\n21.  The primary purpose of this passage is to\nexplore\n(A)   whether or not some people like\ncrows.\n(B)   whether or not crows intentionally\ngive gifts.\n(C)   whether or not pet crows and wild\ncrows behave similarly.\n(D)   whether crow behavior is consistent\nwith other animal behavior.\n22.  From the passage, we can infer that\nscienti\u0000c understanding comes from\n(A)   gift-giving.\n(B)   interpretation.\n(C)   observation.\n(D)   patience.\n23.  In line 3, “engaging” most nearly means\n(A)   critical.\n(B)   dif\u0000cult.\n(C)   humorous.\n(D)   interesting.\n24.  The questions in lines 23–31 are examples of\n(A)   internet research.\n(B)   why some people like crows.\n(C)   detailed laboratory experiments.\n(D)   careful observation as the route to\nunderstanding.25.  In line 38, “recipients” most nearly means\n(A)   accepters.\n(B)   achievers.\n(C)   donors.\n(D)   interpreters.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 37 STOP.

Mendeleev’s mother\n6 saw his potential from an early age. A\n7 year after his father’s death, when he\n8 was fourteen and all of his siblings had\n9 moved away, Mendeleev and his mother\n10 left home to get him into a university.\n11 After being rejected multiple times,\n12 Mendeleev was eventually accepted to\n13 the same university as his father, who\n14 had been an accomplished chemist.\n15 But the 1,600 mile journey to get to\n16 Mendeleev's new university was dif\u0000cult.\n17 Tragically, Mendeleev's mother passed\n18 away shortly after they arrived to\n19 St. Petersburg.\n20       Working in laboratories all day,\n21 Mendeleev began seeing relationships\n22 between elements and started work on a\n23 table to organize the sixty or so that were24 known at the time. The obvious schema\n25 was to organize the emerging table by\n26 atomic weight, but Mendeleev saw that\n27 the most signi\u0000cant relationship between\n28 the elements had nothing to do with\n29 atomic weight, but rather reactivity,\n30 characteristics that were believed to\n31 repeat every seven elements (it is now\n32 known to repeat every eight, which\n33 accounts for the nonreactive noble gases\n34 that hadn’t yet been discovered).\n35 Unfortunately, as the masses of the\n36 elements increased, their relationship\n37 began to look less periodic. Mendeleev\n38 toiled over the table and eventually\n39 realized that the table didn’t work\n40 because there were elements that hadn’t\n41 yet been discovered. He inserted gaps\n42 where the unidenti\u0000ed elements would\n43 be, even accurately predicting the\n44 properties of the missing elements.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #2 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 6-10\n1       W hen Christine Hà won Masterchef, the\n2 famous amateur cooking competition, it came as\n3 a surprise to many, including herself. Hà had\n4 been working as a software consultant when her\n5 vision began to deteriorate. Hà learned that she\n6 suffers from an autoimmune disorder called\n7 neuromyelitis optica, which leads to severely\n8 impaired vision.\n9       As her vision gradually failed, she left her\n10 job and went back to graduate school to get a\n11 degree in creative writing. At the same time,\n12 she pursued her passion for cooking as a\n13 self-taught chef. She began by teaching herself\n14 to make her late mother’s egg roll recipe, using\n15 touch and sound to guide her process. She\n16 learned to listen for the hot oil to spatter\n17 against the pan, and to use her hands to test the\n18 crispiness of the fried shells.\n19       W hile learning to cook with only four senses\n20 was certainly arduous, Hà believes that\n21 using limited senses taught her to pay close\n22 attention to details in her dishes. For example,\n23 while chefs with vision may focus on speed\n24 when cutting vegetables, Hà is very careful\n25 when using her knives, focusing on cutting\n26 precisely. W hen she has \u0000nished a dish, she uses\n27 her hands to create an intricate,\n28 beautifully-constructed plate of food, based off\n29 the design in her mind. As she puts it, “it’s like\n30 my \u0000ngertips have become my eyes. I can learn\n31 so much more by touch than I would have\n32 thought.”\n33       As a visually-impaired chef, Hà has trained34 each of her other four senses to be very sensitive\n35 to her environment. Now, she is able to listen to\n36 several different conversations happening\n37 simultaneously. Additionally, and most\n38 importantly, her sense of taste and smell have\n39 heightened: she can distinguish between\n40 different tastes and scents faster than other\n41 people.\n42       Hà’s perseverance and dedication to the\n43 culinary arts eventually led her to compete on\n44 Masterchef, a show known for its intense\n45 cooking challenges. She auditioned on a whim,\n46 during her last semester of graduate school, and\n47 was surprised to not be eliminated in the \u0000rst\n48 week. In fact, she stayed in the competition until\n49 the end, impressing the judges with her\n50 detail-oriented and delicate dishes.\n51       After becoming the \u0000rst blind contestant to\n52 win the competition, Hà went on to host a\n53 cooking show called “Four Senses,” which was\n54 geared toward visually-impaired viewers, and to\n55 open a Vietnamese gastropub called The Blind\n56 Goat. Pursuing her love for writing, she also\n57 published a cookbook and is at work on a\n58 memoir about her experiences.\n59       Hà’s many accomplishments speak to the\n60 power of adapting and persevering through hard\n61 times. As she has stated, “Everyone in this\n62 world is dealt a different hand—some better,\n63 some worse than others—but what's more\n64 important is how you play that hand.”\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. ",

The musical sound\n4 of poems makes reading them aloud an\n5 enjoyable experience. This is why, for much\n6 of history, poetry written in English has used\n7 rhythm and rhyme.\n8       One conventional form of poetry that\n9 follows a particular kind of rhythm and rhyme\n10 scheme is the sonnet. Taking its name from\n11 the Italian word sonetto, which means “little\n12 song,” sonnets are short, 14-line poems\n13 written in a rhythm called iambic pentameter.\n14       The rhythm of iambic pentameter is\n15 measured with small groups of syllables\n16 called “feet.” The word “iambic” describes\n17 the type of foot that is used: one unstressed\n18 syllable followed by one stressed syllable. In\n19 English, the words “unite” and “provide” are20 both pronounced using the iambic rhythm.\n21 The word “pentameter” tells us how many\n22 iambic feet occur in each line (“penta”\n23 comes from Latin and means “\u0000ve”).\n24       W hile this may seem confusing, an easy\n25 way to think about how iambic pentameter\n26 rhythm is organized is to imagine the sound\n27 of a human heartbeat repeated \u0000ve times:\n28 da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-\n29 DUM.\n30       Now, imagine humming this rhythm\n31 along to the sounds of the words in the\n32 following sentence: “In metric verse the\n33 meter keeps the beat.” The opening line of\n34 Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 12” provides another\n35 good example of the da-DUM rhythm of the\n36 iambic pentameter: “W hen I do count the\n37 clock that tells the time.”\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #2 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1       From the time of its discovery in 1930\n2 until 2006, Pluto was classi\u0000ed as our ninth\n3 planet. Beginning in the late 1970s, this\n4 classi\u0000cation fell under increasing scrutiny\n5 as scientists debated whether Pluto met the\n6 de\u0000nition of a planet or should be\n7 reclassi\u0000ed. Over the years, astronomers\n8 discovered an increasing number of celestial\n9 objects similar to Pluto in our outer solar\n10 system including one particular object, Eris,\n11 with a mass 27% larger than Pluto’s.\n12       Located anywhere between\n13 4,437,000,000 and 7,311,000,000 km from\n14 the Sun, Pluto’s elliptical orbit is far larger\n15 than that of the other planets. It takes\n16 approximately 248 Earth years for Pluto to\n17 complete one orbit around the Sun. Due to\n18 its small mass, the planet’s motion is easily\n19 in\u0000uenced by other objects in the solar\n20 system causing Pluto’s orbit to be relatively\n21 chaotic.\n22       Pluto’s mass, determined by its effect on\n23 the orbits of other planets, was originally\n24 calculated as similar to that of Earth.\n25 However, later estimations decreased until\n26 the University of Hawaii’s observations in\n27 1976 showed that Pluto was no more than\n28 1% the mass of Earth. Pluto’s actual mass,\n29 determined in 1978, is about 0.2% of\n30 Earth’s.\n31       The most recent calculations show Pluto\n32 to be exceptionally tiny in contrast to the\n33 other planets of our solar system. Pluto’s\n34 diameter is only 66% that of the Moon.35 W hile Pluto is more than twice the diameter\n36 of Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid\n37 belt, it is smaller than several moons of\n38 other planets, including Titan, Io, Europa,\n39 and Triton. Pluto is also less massive than\n40 Eris, a trans-Neptunian object discovered in\n41 2005. Due to the observational distance,\n42 scientists cannot be positive which of the\n43 two has a larger diameter. Pluto is so small\n44 that its orbit is affected by one of its own\n45 moons, Charon, leading some scientists to\n46 call Pluto and Charon a dwarf double planet.\n47       With such a small mass, Pluto’s\n48 designation as a planet became quite\n49 controversial. Just as Ceres, Juno, Vesta, and\n50 Pallas (all objects in the asteroid belt) lost\n51 their planet status as astronomers discovered\n52 more asteroids, it was argued that Pluto also\n53 required reclassi\u0000cation. W hen Eris was\n54 discovered in 2005, its discoverers hailed it\n55 as the tenth planet since its mass was similar\n56 to that of Pluto. The astronomy community\n57 viewed this as the strongest argument for\n58 reclassifying Pluto as a dwarf planet. The\n59 debate came to a head with a 2006\n60 resolution by the International Astronomical\n61 Union that of\u0000cially de\u0000ned the term\n62 “planet.” Due to Pluto’s mass, it did not\n63 meet the quali\u0000cations. Pluto was of\u0000cially\n64 reclassi\u0000ed as a dwarf planet, a decision met\n65 with mixed resistance and approval in the\n66 astronomy community.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #2 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       Although crows are criticized for\n2 being noisy or destructive, many people \u0000nd\n3 them engaging and delightful. In fact,\n4 numerous people report receiving gifts from\n5 crows. These include shiny and colorful\n6 objects such as screws, nails, coins, colored\n7 beads, bits of string, and even a candy heart\n8 and a prize from a cereal box. People have\n9 also received pleasing natural objects such\n10 as feathers, pretty stones, twigs, and \u0000owers,\n11 as well as the less welcome gifts of dead\n12 mice, a rotting crab claw, or a frog’s leg.\n13        John Marzluff is a professor of wildlife\n14 science who studies crows. Like all\n15 scientists, he is cautious about interpreting\n16 behavior; scientists try to avoid rushing to\n17 conclusions about what an action—human\n18 or animal—might mean. Marzluff has tried\n19 to \u0000gure out if crows have given these\n20 objects to people intentionally or by\n21 accident. As is true of all science, careful22 observation is the path to understanding.\n23        W ho receives these gifts? Usually it is\n24 people who feed the crows or who have\n25 done a crow a kindness. How do these crows\n26 deposit their gifts? They leave them at the\n27 site where they received the food or where\n28 the kind act occurred. Could all these gift-\n29 giving crows be pets who have escaped? No,\n30 in fact, wild crows give each other gifts\n31 during courtship or to repay debts.\n32        Although these and other observations\n33 are consistent with crow gift-giving as\n34 intentional, Professor Marzluff has been\n35 unable to rule out the possibility that it only\n36 seems intentional, but may really lack a\n37 gifting purpose. He looks forward to more\n38 accounts from gift recipients or to careful\n39 scienti\u0000c experiments to answer this\n40 question.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 36 Go on to the next page. ",
