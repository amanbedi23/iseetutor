Properly\n5 balanced soil contains clay, sand, and\n6 organic matter.\n7       Clay holds moisture well, but can be so\n8 heavy that plants have trouble pushing\n9 through it with their roots and stems. Sand is\n10 light and loose, but cannot hold water, so\n11 plants in soil that is too sandy may get\n12 stressed from thirst in hot weather.\n13       The addition of organic matter will lend\n14 balance to your soil, making it neither too\n15 heavy nor too light. Organic matter helps\n16 maintain healthy levels of moisture and also\n17 provides nutrients such as nitrogen,\n18 phosphorus, and potassium. Symptoms of\n19 nutrient de\u0000ciency include pale yellow20 leaves, poor \u0000owering or fruiting, weak\n21 stems, susceptibility to disease, inadequate\n22 root structure, and brittleness.\n23       There are many good sources of organic\n24 matter. These include leaves, conifer tree\n25 needles, kitchen compost (from decomposed\n26 vegetable scraps), wood products like bark\n27 and sawdust, grass clippings, and manure\n28 (typically chicken or steer).\n29       Healthy soil must also be fertile. Many\n30 of us are familiar with bene\u0000cial worms, but\n31 other creatures too small to see also help\n32 store and distribute nutrients that are\n33 essential to plants. These creatures include\n34 bacteria, fungi, yeasts, protozoa, algae, and\n35 others.

In fact, it\n4 wasn’t until nearly a century later that\n5 Yellowstone was recognized as the \u0000rst\n6 national park in 1872, ensuring that its\n7 diverse ecosystem and unique geographical\n8 attributes would be legally protected.\n9      The reasoning behind this decision was\n10 motivated by several factors. The region's\n11 features, including geysers, hot springs, and\n12 mud pots, fascinated early explorers and\n13 scientists. Their reports and documentation\n14 sparked interest in preserving this unique\n15 natural wonder for future generations.\n16 Because of the combined efforts of\n17 scientists, expeditionary groups, and other\n18 supporters, President Ulysses S. Grant\n19 approved legislation that granted\n20 Yellowstone the title of being the inaugural\n21 national park. This was considered a\n22 signi\u0000cant milestone in the conservation\n23 movement, leading to the safeguarding of\n24 many other precious sites.\n25      Not long after, Sequoia National Park\n26 was recognized in 1890. This park is famous\n27 for its gigantic sequoia trees, which are the\n28 world’s largest trees. These trees can live for\n29 thousands of years and are home to hundreds\n30 of different wildlife species. The main\n31 motivation behind the establishment of\n32 Sequoia National Park was to stop logging\n33 companies from cutting down these\n34 magni\u0000cent trees for timber.\n35      Similar to the Sequoia National Park, the\n36 Great Smoky Mountains National Park was\n37 established due to concerns relating to\n38 deforestation. However, unlike the former park,\n39 the Great Smoky Mountains National Park took\n40 decades of effort before it was of\u0000cially\n41 recognized as a national park. Part of the42 delay was due to the rights to the land. Much\n43 of the land that made up the Smoky\n44 Mountains was already owned by farmers\n45 and other landowners. Through the efforts of\n46 North Carolina and Tennessee residents,\n47 along with the involvement of legislators,\n48 over $5 million was raised to purchase the\n49 land that would become part of the park.\n50 Finally, in 1934—nearly forty years since the\n51 idea was \u0000rst proposed—the Great Smoky\n52 Mountains National Park was formed.\n53      One of the newer members of the National\n54 Park family is Pinnacles, which became a park\n55 in 2013. Pinnacles National Park, located in\n56 California, is celebrated for its unique\n57 geological formations and diverse\n58 ecosystems. Known for its towering rock\n59 spires and rugged cliffs, the park is like a\n60 playground for hikers and climbers alike.\n61 The unique formation of this site is the result\n62 of many volcanic eruptions millions of years\n63 ago. As molten lava and volcanic ash cooled\n64 and solidi\u0000ed, they formed layers of volcanic\n65 rock. Over time, these layers were buried\n66 and compacted, creating the formations that\n67 make up the Pinnacles' iconic spires and\n68 cliffs.\n69      Yellowstone National Park's creation\n70 marked a shift in how people viewed and\n71 valued natural landscapes. It highlighted\n72 the idea that certain places should be preserved\n73 for their scienti\u0000c importance and for the\n74 enjoyment of present and future generations.\n75 So, whether you're marveling at the massive\n76 mountains in Rocky Mountain National Park,\n77 or just taking a quiet walk among the tall\n78 trees in Redwood National Park, remember\n79 that these places are protected so you can\n80 enjoy them and learn about the incredible\n81 beauty of our planet.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #6 v11.0 - RC\n6.  The primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   explain the historical signi\u0000cance and\nmotivations behind the establishment\nof various national parks in the United\nStates.\n(B)   defend the need for increased funding\nand governmental support for the\npreservation of national parks in the\nUnited States.\n(C)   describe the various recreational\nactivities available in national parks\nand the overall perception of these\nparks among visitors.\n(D)   discuss the challenges faced by\nnational parks in maintaining their\necological balance and the measures\nbeing taken to address these issues.\n7.  W hich word best describes the author’s\ntone in the passage?\n(A)   alarmed\n(B)   appreciative\n(C)   critical\n(D)   indifferent\n8.  W hich best describes the organization of\nthe passage?\n(A)   in chronological order\n(B)   in order of importance\n(C)   by geographical location\n(D)   from least known to most known park9.  In the second paragraph (line 20),\n“inaugural” most nearly means\n(A)   celebrated.\n(B)   \u0000rst.\n(C)   noteworthy.\n(D)   largest.\n10.  According to the \u0000fth paragraph (lines 53–\n68), the rocky terrain that is characteristic\nof the Pinnacles was formed\n(A)   by the slow shifting of volcanoes over\ntime.\n(B)   through volcanic substances\nsolidifying into rock form.\n(C)   due to the accumulation of\nsedimentary deposits from local\nrivers.\n(D)   through gradual erosion caused by\nwind and water over millions of years.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 31 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #6 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 11-15\n1      “Everybody’s gone sur\u0000n’ —Sur\u0000n’ USA!”\n2 so sang The Beach Boys in 1963 during the\n3 peak of California surf culture. W hen most of us\n4 think of sur\u0000ng, we picture surfer “dudes”\n5 with their shaggy blond hairdos and\n6 generally chill vibe. But for the Polynesian\n7 societies of the Paci\u0000c, sur\u0000ng was not\n8 merely a recreational activity, but a culturally\n9 signi\u0000cant aspect of life that even had\n10 religious overtones.\n11      The sport of sur\u0000ng itself is thousands of\n12 years old, as the earliest historical evidence of\n13 sur\u0000ng comes from cave paintings in\n14 Polynesia which date back to the 12th\n15 century. For the inhabitants of Polynesia,\n16 which includes the islands of Hawaii,\n17 Tahiti, Samoa, and Fiji, sur\u0000ng was both a\n18 spiritual practice and a practical means of\n19 transportation. It is no wonder that the\n20 ancient Polynesians, surrounded by the vast\n21 ocean, regarded it as a sacred entity.\n22 Sur\u0000ng, or wave riding, was a way for the\n23 islanders to directly commune with their\n24 deities. The surfer could channel the divine\n25 energy and powerful elemental forces while\n26 navigating the waves. More practically,\n27 navigating the waves became a convenient\n28 way for the Polynesians to navigate\n29 between their own neighboring islands\n30 and to explore new territories. In fact, it was\n31 the ancient Polynesians who brought their\n32 culture and the reverence for sur\u0000ng to the\n33 Hawaiian islands. Using only their\n34 knowledge of the wind and ocean currents\n35 and their observations of the stars, these36 legendary islanders traveled over 2500\n37 miles of ocean in their outrigger and surf\n38 canoes from Tahiti to Hawaii.\n39      In Hawaii, sur\u0000ng dates back to the \u0000fth\n40 century, after the ancient Polynesians\n41 settled there. Sur\u0000ng was of such cultural\n42 importance that kings and queens,\n43 commoners, and even children took part in\n44 He’e Nalu - the art of wave riding.\n45 But while participation was universal among\n46 the Hawaiian people, royalty enjoyed\n47 particular privileges. Only the king and his\n48 wife were allowed to surf at the best spots.\n49 Even the type of surfboard indicated status.\n50 W hile the commoners used the\n51 paipo, which ranged from 3 to 6 feet\n52 in length, only the royalty could ride\n53 the olo, which measured from 10 to\n54 20 feet in length. Additionally, the choice of\n55 wood to construct the surfboard had a\n56 religious signi\u0000cance. The priest, or\n57 kahuna, would guide surfers\n58 and make offerings as he led them to select\n59 wood from trees such as the ulu, wiliwili, or\n60 koa.\n61      This sacred worship of sur\u0000ng is shared by\n62 surf enthusiasts all over the world. Although\n63 this ancient art is no longer used as a way\n64 of selecting the next tribal chief, sur\u0000ng has\n65 now become an Olympic sport. So while the\n66 best and most talented wave rider may no\n67 longer earn the title of chief, he or she can\n68 still win the title of Olympic champion surfer.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #6 v11.0 - RC\n11.  The main purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   encourage people to try sur\u0000ng.\n(B)   provide a cultural history of sur\u0000ng.\n(C)   urge people to conserve ulu, wiliwili,\nand koa trees.\n(D)   describe the types of surfboards used\nby native Hawaiians.\n12.  According the passage, sur\u0000ng has been\npracticed\n(A)   since the 1960s.\n(B)   only by Hawaiians.\n(C)   exclusively by royalty.\n(D)   for thousands of years.\n13.  In line 23, \"commune\" most nearly means\n(A)   to swim to.\n(B)   to live with.\n(C)   to connect with.\n(D)   to navigate from.\n14.  It can be inferred from the passage that\n(A)   only royalty were allowed to surf.\n(B)   the best surf spots are in California.\n(C)   in the 1960s, sur\u0000ng became an\nOlympic sport.\n(D)   sur\u0000ng was a skill revered by the\nancestors of indigenous Hawaiians.15.  W hat tone does the author use when\ndescribing sur\u0000ng?\n(A)   critical\n(B)   enthusiastic\n(C)   respectful\n(D)   surprised\n© 2025 Test Innovators 33 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #6 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1       Humans use many means to understand\n2 the world. Among these are personal\n3 experience, art, religion, and science. In\n4 order to be considered “science,” ideas and\n5 the exploration of those ideas must meet a\n6 number of criteria.\n7       Science begins with curiosity about an\n8 observation. To be addressed in the realm of\n9 science, this curiosity must be shaped into\n10 testable form. Questions must be turned into\n11 statements. For example, we cannot\n12 scienti\u0000cally test queries such as, “How\n13 long does it take a monarch butter\u0000y to\n14 emerge from its cocoon?” However, the\n15 statement “monarch butter\u0000ies emerge from\n16 their cocoons in twenty to twenty-\u0000ve days”\n17 can be tested: we can determine whether this\n18 is true or false. This kind of testable statement\n19 is called a hypothesis.\n20       Once you state your hypothesis, you\n21 need evidence with which to test it. You\n22 need evidence to establish when the cocoons\n23 were made and how many days it took each\n24 one to hatch. To gather this evidence, you\n25 must observe carefully. The evidence\n26 resulting from careful observation will either\n27 support your hypothesis or it will not. For\n28 example, a \u0000nding in which a monarch\n29 butter\u0000y takes twenty-two days to hatch\n30 supports your hypothesis. A \u0000nding of a\n31 butter\u0000y taking twenty-nine days to hatch\n32 does not. Careful observation of the real\n33 world (not an imagined world) is the heart of34 science.\n35       To gather the evidence needed to test\n36 your hypothesis, you design a method or\n37 study that lets you make the necessary\n38 observations. How many cocoons will you\n39 need? How will you know when they were\n40 spun? How will you know when they hatch?\n41       It is also important for scientists to share\n42 their methods and conclusions with other\n43 scientists by publishing detailed descriptions\n44 of their work. To lend con\u0000dence to our\n45 conclusions, these other scientists should be\n46 able to exactly copy the same experiment\n47 and arrive at the same results. This is how\n48 scientists form scienti\u0000c theories.\n49       A scienti\u0000c theory is a model of how the\n50 world relevant to the topic works. Theories\n51 re\u0000ect our best knowledge to date. They are\n52 developed and revised over time as many\n53 researchers do the same experiment and\n54 come to the same conclusions. Without\n55 getting the same results from many different\n56 scientists at different times, we cannot\n57 construct theories. In our example, scientists\n58 reproducing each other’s experiments would\n59 build a theory of what makes cocoons hatch\n60 in a given number of days. This theory\n61 might include the effects of temperature,\n62 diet, hours of daylight, or pesticides. In this\n63 way, the theory explains how or why the\n64 hypothesis works.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #6 v11.0 - RC\n16.  W hich sentence best expresses the main\npoint of the passage?\n(A)   Scientists spend most of their time\nrepeating experiments already done\nby other scientists.\n(B)   The hypothesis is the foundation of\nscience and other steps in the\nscienti\u0000c method are unnecessary.\n(C)   Science is superior to all the other\nways in which people seek to\nunderstand the world.\n(D)   Accurate observation of actual events\nand the sharing of any \u0000ndings are the\nbasis of science.\n17.  According to the passage, a scienti\u0000c theory\nis a(n)\n(A)   possible scenario not related to the\nphysical world.\n(B)   model of how a particular part of the\nworld works.\n(C)   idea or hunch that may not have much\nevidence to support it.\n(D)   summary of the questions that\nscientists have asked over time.18.  The passage provides information to\nsupport which statement?\n(A)   Science is so technical that natural\ncuriosity plays a minor role.\n(B)   Science is a method of learning about\nthe nature of the world and the causes\nof things.\n(C)   Thinking very carefully about how the\nworld might work is as effective as\nactual observation.\n(D)   Research shows that the cocoons of\nmonarch butter\u0000ies take longer to\nhatch in certain conditions.\n19.  The primary purpose of the second\nparagraph (lines 7–19) is to explain\n(A)   the importance of being able to test a\nhypothesis.\n(B)   that a hypothesis does not require a\nbasis in reality.\n(C)   that nearly any sentence can make a\ngood scienti\u0000c hypothesis.\n(D)   how curiosity can get in the way of\nforming a testable hypothesis.\n20.  In line 28, the expression “a \u0000nding” most\nnearly means\n(A)   a conclusion.\n(B)   a hypothesis.\n(C)   a scienti\u0000c fact.\n(D)   an observed result.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 35 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #6 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       The events that eventually led to the\n2 Seven Years’ War began in 1749 when\n3 the governor of Virginia gave a land\n4 grant to the Ohio Company. The\n5 American Natives and French\n6 immediately took issue with this because\n7 they thought they each had exclusive\n8 rights to the land. Not considering the\n9 Native Americans’ claim an issue, the\n10 Ohio Company asked the French to\n11 recognize the company’s claim; the\n12 French, however, declined. Essentially,\n13 though their reasons were complex, the\n14 French did not want to cede land to a\n15 rival.\n16       The actual \u0000ghting began when\n17 British colonists, led by George\n18 Washington, tried to dislodge the French\n19 from the forts they’d been building in\n20 Western Pennsylvania. However, things\n21 didn’t start out well. The British22 ended up building Fort Necessity, only\n23 to be quickly forced to abandon it. This\n24 was followed by a second loss during a\n25 battle in which the French bombarded\n26 Fort Duquesne.

      "text": "Lower #6 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 1-5\n1       Since the soil in most fruit and vegetable\n2 gardens is the major source of nutrition for\n3 the plants that grow there, it is critical to pay\n4 attention to its preparation. Properly\n5 balanced soil contains clay, sand, and\n6 organic matter.\n7       Clay holds moisture well, but can be so\n8 heavy that plants have trouble pushing\n9 through it with their roots and stems. Sand is\n10 light and loose, but cannot hold water, so\n11 plants in soil that is too sandy may get\n12 stressed from thirst in hot weather.\n13       The addition of organic matter will lend\n14 balance to your soil, making it neither too\n15 heavy nor too light. Organic matter helps\n16 maintain healthy levels of moisture and also\n17 provides nutrients such as nitrogen,\n18 phosphorus, and potassium. Symptoms of\n19 nutrient de\u0000ciency include pale yellow20 leaves, poor \u0000owering or fruiting, weak\n21 stems, susceptibility to disease, inadequate\n22 root structure, and brittleness.\n23       There are many good sources of organic\n24 matter. These include leaves, conifer tree\n25 needles, kitchen compost (from decomposed\n26 vegetable scraps), wood products like bark\n27 and sawdust, grass clippings, and manure\n28 (typically chicken or steer).\n29       Healthy soil must also be fertile. Many\n30 of us are familiar with bene\u0000cial worms, but\n31 other creatures too small to see also help\n32 store and distribute nutrients that are\n33 essential to plants. These creatures include\n34 bacteria, fungi, yeasts, protozoa, algae, and\n35 others. The successful gardener tends the\n36 soil to make it an attractive home for these\n37 millions of beings that plants depend on.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. ",

In fact, it\n4 wasn’t until nearly a century later that\n5 Yellowstone was recognized as the \u0000rst\n6 national park in 1872, ensuring that its\n7 diverse ecosystem and unique geographical\n8 attributes would be legally protected.\n9      The reasoning behind this decision was\n10 motivated by several factors. The region's\n11 features, including geysers, hot springs, and\n12 mud pots, fascinated early explorers and\n13 scientists. Their reports and documentation\n14 sparked interest in preserving this unique\n15 natural wonder for future generations.\n16 Because of the combined efforts of\n17 scientists, expeditionary groups, and other\n18 supporters, President Ulysses S. Grant\n19 approved legislation that granted\n20 Yellowstone the title of being the inaugural\n21 national park. This was considered a\n22 signi\u0000cant milestone in the conservation\n23 movement, leading to the safeguarding of\n24 many other precious sites.\n25      Not long after, Sequoia National Park\n26 was recognized in 1890. This park is famous\n27 for its gigantic sequoia trees, which are the\n28 world’s largest trees. These trees can live for\n29 thousands of years and are home to hundreds\n30 of different wildlife species. The main\n31 motivation behind the establishment of\n32 Sequoia National Park was to stop logging\n33 companies from cutting down these\n34 magni\u0000cent trees for timber.\n35      Similar to the Sequoia National Park, the\n36 Great Smoky Mountains National Park was\n37 established due to concerns relating to\n38 deforestation. However, unlike the former park,\n39 the Great Smoky Mountains National Park took\n40 decades of effort before it was of\u0000cially\n41 recognized as a national park. Part of the42 delay was due to the rights to the land. Much\n43 of the land that made up the Smoky\n44 Mountains was already owned by farmers\n45 and other landowners. Through the efforts of\n46 North Carolina and Tennessee residents,\n47 along with the involvement of legislators,\n48 over $5 million was raised to purchase the\n49 land that would become part of the park.\n50 Finally, in 1934—nearly forty years since the\n51 idea was \u0000rst proposed—the Great Smoky\n52 Mountains National Park was formed.\n53      One of the newer members of the National\n54 Park family is Pinnacles, which became a park\n55 in 2013. Pinnacles National Park, located in\n56 California, is celebrated for its unique\n57 geological formations and diverse\n58 ecosystems. Known for its towering rock\n59 spires and rugged cliffs, the park is like a\n60 playground for hikers and climbers alike.\n61 The unique formation of this site is the result\n62 of many volcanic eruptions millions of years\n63 ago. As molten lava and volcanic ash cooled\n64 and solidi\u0000ed, they formed layers of volcanic\n65 rock. Over time, these layers were buried\n66 and compacted, creating the formations that\n67 make up the Pinnacles' iconic spires and\n68 cliffs.\n69      Yellowstone National Park's creation\n70 marked a shift in how people viewed and\n71 valued natural landscapes. It highlighted\n72 the idea that certain places should be preserved\n73 for their scienti\u0000c importance and for the\n74 enjoyment of present and future generations.\n75 So, whether you're marveling at the massive\n76 mountains in Rocky Mountain National Park,\n77 or just taking a quiet walk among the tall\n78 trees in Redwood National Park, remember\n79 that these places are protected so you can\n80 enjoy them and learn about the incredible\n81 beauty of our planet.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. ",

W hen most of us\n4 think of sur\u0000ng, we picture surfer “dudes”\n5 with their shaggy blond hairdos and\n6 generally chill vibe. But for the Polynesian\n7 societies of the Paci\u0000c, sur\u0000ng was not\n8 merely a recreational activity, but a culturally\n9 signi\u0000cant aspect of life that even had\n10 religious overtones.\n11      The sport of sur\u0000ng itself is thousands of\n12 years old, as the earliest historical evidence of\n13 sur\u0000ng comes from cave paintings in\n14 Polynesia which date back to the 12th\n15 century. For the inhabitants of Polynesia,\n16 which includes the islands of Hawaii,\n17 Tahiti, Samoa, and Fiji, sur\u0000ng was both a\n18 spiritual practice and a practical means of\n19 transportation. It is no wonder that the\n20 ancient Polynesians, surrounded by the vast\n21 ocean, regarded it as a sacred entity.\n22 Sur\u0000ng, or wave riding, was a way for the\n23 islanders to directly commune with their\n24 deities. The surfer could channel the divine\n25 energy and powerful elemental forces while\n26 navigating the waves. More practically,\n27 navigating the waves became a convenient\n28 way for the Polynesians to navigate\n29 between their own neighboring islands\n30 and to explore new territories. In fact, it was\n31 the ancient Polynesians who brought their\n32 culture and the reverence for sur\u0000ng to the\n33 Hawaiian islands. Using only their\n34 knowledge of the wind and ocean currents\n35 and their observations of the stars, these36 legendary islanders traveled over 2500\n37 miles of ocean in their outrigger and surf\n38 canoes from Tahiti to Hawaii.\n39      In Hawaii, sur\u0000ng dates back to the \u0000fth\n40 century, after the ancient Polynesians\n41 settled there. Sur\u0000ng was of such cultural\n42 importance that kings and queens,\n43 commoners, and even children took part in\n44 He’e Nalu - the art of wave riding.\n45 But while participation was universal among\n46 the Hawaiian people, royalty enjoyed\n47 particular privileges. Only the king and his\n48 wife were allowed to surf at the best spots.\n49 Even the type of surfboard indicated status.\n50 W hile the commoners used the\n51 paipo, which ranged from 3 to 6 feet\n52 in length, only the royalty could ride\n53 the olo, which measured from 10 to\n54 20 feet in length. Additionally, the choice of\n55 wood to construct the surfboard had a\n56 religious signi\u0000cance. The priest, or\n57 kahuna, would guide surfers\n58 and make offerings as he led them to select\n59 wood from trees such as the ulu, wiliwili, or\n60 koa.\n61      This sacred worship of sur\u0000ng is shared by\n62 surf enthusiasts all over the world. Although\n63 this ancient art is no longer used as a way\n64 of selecting the next tribal chief, sur\u0000ng has\n65 now become an Olympic sport. So while the\n66 best and most talented wave rider may no\n67 longer earn the title of chief, he or she can\n68 still win the title of Olympic champion surfer.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #6 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1       Humans use many means to understand\n2 the world. Among these are personal\n3 experience, art, religion, and science. In\n4 order to be considered “science,” ideas and\n5 the exploration of those ideas must meet a\n6 number of criteria.\n7       Science begins with curiosity about an\n8 observation. To be addressed in the realm of\n9 science, this curiosity must be shaped into\n10 testable form. Questions must be turned into\n11 statements. For example, we cannot\n12 scienti\u0000cally test queries such as, “How\n13 long does it take a monarch butter\u0000y to\n14 emerge from its cocoon?” However, the\n15 statement “monarch butter\u0000ies emerge from\n16 their cocoons in twenty to twenty-\u0000ve days”\n17 can be tested: we can determine whether this\n18 is true or false. This kind of testable statement\n19 is called a hypothesis.\n20       Once you state your hypothesis, you\n21 need evidence with which to test it. You\n22 need evidence to establish when the cocoons\n23 were made and how many days it took each\n24 one to hatch. To gather this evidence, you\n25 must observe carefully. The evidence\n26 resulting from careful observation will either\n27 support your hypothesis or it will not. For\n28 example, a \u0000nding in which a monarch\n29 butter\u0000y takes twenty-two days to hatch\n30 supports your hypothesis. A \u0000nding of a\n31 butter\u0000y taking twenty-nine days to hatch\n32 does not. Careful observation of the real\n33 world (not an imagined world) is the heart of34 science.\n35       To gather the evidence needed to test\n36 your hypothesis, you design a method or\n37 study that lets you make the necessary\n38 observations. How many cocoons will you\n39 need? How will you know when they were\n40 spun? How will you know when they hatch?\n41       It is also important for scientists to share\n42 their methods and conclusions with other\n43 scientists by publishing detailed descriptions\n44 of their work. To lend con\u0000dence to our\n45 conclusions, these other scientists should be\n46 able to exactly copy the same experiment\n47 and arrive at the same results. This is how\n48 scientists form scienti\u0000c theories.\n49       A scienti\u0000c theory is a model of how the\n50 world relevant to the topic works. Theories\n51 re\u0000ect our best knowledge to date. They are\n52 developed and revised over time as many\n53 researchers do the same experiment and\n54 come to the same conclusions. Without\n55 getting the same results from many different\n56 scientists at different times, we cannot\n57 construct theories. In our example, scientists\n58 reproducing each other’s experiments would\n59 build a theory of what makes cocoons hatch\n60 in a given number of days. This theory\n61 might include the effects of temperature,\n62 diet, hours of daylight, or pesticides. In this\n63 way, the theory explains how or why the\n64 hypothesis works.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #6 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       The events that eventually led to the\n2 Seven Years’ War began in 1749 when\n3 the governor of Virginia gave a land\n4 grant to the Ohio Company. The\n5 American Natives and French\n6 immediately took issue with this because\n7 they thought they each had exclusive\n8 rights to the land. Not considering the\n9 Native Americans’ claim an issue, the\n10 Ohio Company asked the French to\n11 recognize the company’s claim; the\n12 French, however, declined. Essentially,\n13 though their reasons were complex, the\n14 French did not want to cede land to a\n15 rival.\n16       The actual \u0000ghting began when\n17 British colonists, led by George\n18 Washington, tried to dislodge the French\n19 from the forts they’d been building in\n20 Western Pennsylvania. However, things\n21 didn’t start out well. The British22 ended up building Fort Necessity, only\n23 to be quickly forced to abandon it. This\n24 was followed by a second loss during a\n25 battle in which the French bombarded\n26 Fort Duquesne. They ended up killing\n27 General Bradock, the commanding\n28 of\u0000cer, and two thirds of his men.\n29       Failure and defeat seemed to follow\n30 the British for most of the rest of the\n31 war, and into multiple countries, until\n32 1759 when the British captured forts\n33 Duquesne, Ticonderoga, and\n34 Louisbourg. They then had an\n35 overwhelming victory against the French\n36 on the Plains of Abraham near the city of\n37 Quebec in Canada. After three more\n38 years, the British were victorious on\n39 multiple fronts in locations including\n40 France, North America, and India,\n41 ending with the Treaty of Paris in 1763.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 36 Go on to the next page. ",
