There they found a young\n8 woman in long silk robes. She was\n9 surrounded by several helpers. Stopped at\n10 the edge of the river, she was waiting to step\n11 out of her carriage. Her followers were\n12 carrying so many of her many packages and\n13 possessions that they could not help her to\n14 cross the river. Rain had left the river waters\n15 high; the woman sat with her back straight\n16 and tall, impatient and speaking unkindly to\n17 those helping her.\n18       The younger of the two monks saw the\n19 woman and continued walking. However,\n20 the older monk, seeing her distress, lifted\n21 her up onto his shoulder. He carried her\n22 across the river and set her gently on the\n23 other side.\n24       The young woman, now safe on the\n25 Earth, simply turned away. She did not say a\n26 word of thanks to the older monk.27       The two monks, now both safely across\n28 the river, continued on their way.\n29       As they traveled, the younger monk\n30 barely noticed the sky or even the twisting\n31 dirt path in front of him. He was lost in\n32 thought, mulling over the encounter with\n33 the woman.\n34       Later in the afternoon, the older monk\n35 \u0000nally stopped; he could feel the younger\n36 monk’s stormy thoughts. He paused,\n37 breathing steadily in the falling sunlight.\n38 “Brother,” he said to the younger monk,\n39 \"what is wrong?\"\n40       The younger monk began, “That young\n41 woman was rude and ungrateful. Not only\n42 did she not thank you, but as monks, our\n43 spiritual tradition advises us to avoid\n44 touching women… yet you lifted her onto\n45 your shoulder and carried her. How could\n46 you break our vows and carry her?”\n47       The older monk gently replied,\n48 “Brother, I put her down by the river’s edge\n49 a long ways back.

It is a beautiful\n3 country. The pace of life is slow. The\n4 Mediterranean weather is so dry and hot in\n5 the direct summer sun, but in the breezy\n6 shade, the temperature is almost perfect.\n7       We took a road trip on our own through\n8 the countryside. Although we were able to\n9 pick up bits of words that sounded like the\n10 little Spanish we knew, Portuguese was\n11 different enough that we often asked for\n12 directions but then ended up getting further\n13 lost. However, the people we came across\n14 were so friendly and helpful; they acted out\n15 animated gestures, marking roads and\n16 roundabouts, speaking patiently and slowly,\n17 hoping we’d understand their deliberate\n18 words.\n19       As we journeyed, we came across acres\n20 and acres of farms terraced for grapes.21 Portugal is largely agricultural, and\n22 apparently wine is one of its largest\n23 industries. Walking through some of the\n24 grape \u0000elds, I was awed by the late\n25 afternoon light. The earth was a honey\n26 brown, and the grape leaves a fresh, almost\n27 electric green. One early evening, the sky\n28 was splashed with hot oranges and pinks;\n29 indigo blue storm clouds lifted to the right. I\n30 thought, “Ahh, this is what the\n31 Impressionists were painting.”\n32       We visited a lot of little towns on that\n33 road trip before ending up in Coimbra and\n34 Miranda. We passed streets and streets of\n35 white buildings with red clay tiled roofs.\n36 Almost every building front had chairs or\n37 benches where people simply sat and\n38 enjoyed life.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #4 v11.0 - RC\n6.  The primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   offer a brief history of Portugal.\n(B)   describe some of the author’s\nimpressions of Portugal.\n(C)   express how traveling in foreign\ncountries can be challenging.\n(D)   discuss the differences between\nPortugal and the author’s country of\norigin.\n7.  The passage states that the Portuguese\nlanguage was unfamiliar to the author and\nso\n(A)   the author was hesitant to travel\nalone.\n(B)   the author was only able to enjoy the\nscenic beauty of Portugal.\n(C)   the author found it dif\u0000cult to make\nnew friends while traveling in\nPortugal.\n(D)   the author often had dif\u0000culty\nproperly following directions when\ntraveling.\n8.  The passage provides information to answer\nwhich question?\n(A)   Is wine Portugal’s oldest agricultural\nindustry?\n(B)   How many seasons was the author\ntraveling in Portugal?\n(C)   W hat is the author’s sense of the pace\nof life in Portugal?\n(D)   W hat are some examples of words\nthat are similar in the Portuguese and\nSpanish languages?9.  In line 17, “deliberate” most nearly means\n(A)   apologetic.\n(B)   careful.\n(C)   haphazard.\n(D)   musical.\n10.  According to the passage, the author most\nlikely thought “Ahh, this is what the\nImpressionists were painting” (lines 30–31)\nbecause\n(A)   the late afternoon light was awe-\ninspiring.\n(B)   weather often affects the human\nimagination.\n(C)   the author remembered seeing grapes\nin Impressionist paintings.\n(D)   Portugal is in Europe, and\nImpressionist painting developed in\nEurope.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 29 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #4 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 11-15\n1      W hile most people in the United States wait\n2 until after Thanksgiving to put up Christmas\n3 decorations, the inhabitants of one Southeast\n4 Asian country eagerly await the “BER” months—\n5 September, October, November, and\n6 December—as those months of\u0000cially herald the\n7 Yuletide season. If you visit the Philippines in\n8 September, you will likely see decorators on\n9 scaffolding erecting giant Christmas trees and\n10 adorning buildings with garlands of lights. You\n11 will likely see many variations of the most\n12 popular and indicative Pasko (the Filipino name\n13 for Christmas) decoration - the parol.\n14      The parol is a \u0000ve pointed star lantern and its\n15 name is derived from the Spanish word “farol,”\n16 which means lantern or light. Indeed, before\n17 electricity came to the provinces, the parol was\n18 originally used to light the way from Filipinos’\n19 homes to the church mass. Then, instead of\n20 putting their lanterns away, Filipinos would hang\n21 the parols in front of their houses. Eventually,\n22 these star-shaped lanterns became the iconic\n23 Pasko symbol of Christmas in the Philippines.\n24      According to Philippine history, the \u0000rst\n25 parol was crafted in 1908 by Francisco\n26 Estanislao. The original parol was very simple –27 the frame was made from bamboo and covered\n28 with Japanese paper, which is translucent. Inside,\n29 there was enough room to place a candle. Before\n30 long, making parols for the Advent season\n31 became a tradition for many Filipino families,\n32 and the parol itself came to symbolize the Star of\n33 Bethlehem lighting the way for the Three Wise\n34 Men, much like the lantern would light the way\n35 for the Filipino villagers. These days the parol is\n36 no longer necessary as a means of illumination,\n37 and with the advancements in technology, the\n38 candlelit star lantern has evolved into a\n39 brilliantly \u0000ashing LED spectacle.\n40      In fact, these spectacular parols have\n41 inspired their own celebration known as the\n42 Giant Lantern Festival. The festival takes place\n43 in Pampanga, a province of Luzon. This\n44 event is celebrated on the Saturday preceding\n45 Christmas, and craftsmen from all over the\n46 country compete to win the trophy for the most\n47 beautiful lantern. Although there can only be one\n48 crowned winner, the true prize is won by the\n49 spectators who have the opportunity to wonder at\n50 all the illuminated works of art.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #4 v11.0 - RC\n11.  The primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   encourage people to make star\nlanterns.\n(B)   discuss the history of a cultural\ndecoration.\n(C)   analyze the types of materials used to\nmake a parol.\n(D)   give background information about\nthe Giant Lantern Festival.\n12.  According to the passage, Pasko is\n(A)   a wise man.\n(B)   a type of lantern.\n(C)   the name of a province in the\nPhilippines.\n(D)   a holiday celebrated by people in\nSoutheast Asia.\n13.  In line 28, “translucent” most nearly means\n(A)   rarely obtained.\n(B)   intricately designed.\n(C)   culturally signi\u0000cant.\n(D)   letting light through.\n14.  In the passage, why were parols initially\nused?\n(A)   to give thanks\n(B)   to light a pathway\n(C)   to symbolize a star\n(D)   to decorate houses15.  The author implies that Filipinos eagerly\nanticipate the last few months of the year\nbecause\n(A)   they visit all their relatives.\n(B)   the weather is best at the end of the\nyear.\n(C)   they travel from their villages to\nchurch.\n(D)   they start decorating their homes and\nbuildings for Christmas.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 31 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #4 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1       As I was driving to a friend’s house, I\n2 tried a new route. Turning off a major road\n3 onto a side street, I discovered something.\n4 Spread out under my car, painted right onto\n5 the pavement, was a huge, brightly colored\n6 dragon\u0000y. It covered the street from curb to\n7 curb, \u0000lling the entire intersection.\n8 Truthfully, I couldn’t tell what it was at \u0000rst.\n9 To determine its nature, I had to slow down\n10 and examine it carefully.\n11       Later, my friend explained this unusual\n12 neighborhood greeting. It is an example of\n13 traf\u0000c calming measures. These measures,\n14 common in Europe, include traf\u0000c circles,\n15 bicycle lanes, speed bumps, and more. To\n16 my mind, although they share the same\n17 purpose, painted pavement is potentially far18 more delightful than a speed bump.\n19       Busy cities in the U.S. are increasingly\n20 using such strategies to slow or space out\n21 vehicles and/or to increase safety. As you\n22 can imagine, a single “car calming” strategy\n23 often achieves more than one of these goals.\n24 I certainly slowed down in order to\n25 determine the subject of the painting and to\n26 enjoy it, and slowing down probably made\n27 my car less dangerous to pedestrians and\n28 bicyclists also using the intersection.\n29 However, I’m not sure this particular traf\u0000c\n30 calming measure reduces car volume. Now I\n31 always approach my friend’s home using\n32 this route just so I can re-visit that charming\n33 insect.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #4 v11.0 - RC\n16.  The primary purpose of the passage is to\ndiscuss\n(A)   an example of a traf\u0000c law.\n(B)   the delights and functions of public\nart.\n(C)   an example of a traf\u0000c calming\nstrategy.\n(D)   the signi\u0000cance of the various\ndistractions that many drivers face.\n17.  According to the passage, cities adopt\ntraf\u0000c calming measures in order to\n(A)   attract new residents and visitors.\n(B)   save money due to accident\nprevention.\n(C)   improve the attractiveness of\nneighborhoods and streets.\n(D)   increase safety, decrease traf\u0000c\ndensity, and decrease traf\u0000c speed.\n18.  Based on this passage, we might predict\nthat\n(A)   Europeans have embraced the use of\ntraf\u0000c calming measures.\n(B)   U.S. citizens are likely to reject the use\nof traf\u0000c calming measures.\n(C)   traf\u0000c calming measures only\nmodestly improve pedestrian safety.\n(D)   small towns are more likely than big\ncities to adopt traf\u0000c calming\nmeasures.19.  W hich of the following can be inferred from\nthis passage?\n(A)   The author would prefer to travel by\nfoot or bicycle.\n(B)   Most drivers \u0000nd traf\u0000c calming\nmeasures annoying.\n(C)   Europe has solved the majority of its\ntraf\u0000c safety problems.\n(D)   The author’s friend lives in a\nneighborhood where traf\u0000c safety has\nbeen a problem.\n20.  Lines 9 and 10 suggest that\n(A)   the driver lacked curiosity.\n(B)   the painting was poorly done and hard\nto discern.\n(C)   paintings on pavement lead to traf\u0000c\ncongestion.\n(D)   traf\u0000c calming measures sometimes\nrely on visual cues.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 33 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #4 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1      W hen you think about black and white\n2 birds that enjoy cold climates and dive into icy\n3 waters for their dinner, the \u0000rst animal to pop\n4 into your mind is probably the penguin.\n5 However, there is a lesser-known bird that shares\n6 many characteristics of a penguin yet is an\n7 entirely different bird altogether—the puf\u0000n.\n8 This interesting bird has black and white\n9 feathers, orange-red feet, and a brightly colored\n10 beak during the mating season that sheds and\n11 reveals a small, duller one underneath.\n12      Many consider the puf\u0000n to be quite the\n13 odd bird which is noted in its various namesakes.\n14 Puf\u0000ns are stocky with short wings, which\n15 relates to the English word “puf\u0000n,” meaning\n16 small and swollen. Its genus, Fratercula,\n17 comes from the Latin word for “little brother or\n18 friar,” as its black and white plumage looks\n19 strikingly like monks' robes. Finally, due to its\n20 distinctive coloring, the birds have also been\n21 referred to “clowns of the sea” and “sea parrots.”\n22      Even their stout, brightly colored appearance\n23 can’t save the puf\u0000n from its natural enemy—\n24 man. Puf\u0000ns reside in coastal areas in both the\n25 Atlantic and Paci\u0000c Ocean. Atlantic puf\u0000ns are\n26 hunted as part of Iceland’s normal diet. By using\n27 nets to catch the birds just before they dive into\n28 the water, \u0000shermen are capable of bringing\n29 down a few hundred birds in some hours’ time.\n30 Puf\u0000n meat is a popular menu item at Icelandic\n31 hotels, and the raw heart of a puf\u0000n makes for a\n32 macabre delicacy. Paci\u0000c puf\u0000ns reside in the\n33 North Paci\u0000c Ocean region, including34 Washington, British Columbia, Alaska, and\n35 Siberia.\n36      An interesting aspect of puf\u0000ns is how they\n37 can maneuver in the water. They are such strong\n38 ocean hunters that their dives are often referred\n39 to as underwater \u0000ight. Their wings work with\n40 their webbed feet to steer and propel themselves\n41 quickly through the water. It’s no surprise that\n42 puf\u0000ns are quite talented in the water as they\n43 spend about half of their lives there. They even\n44 have waterproof plumage, which is due to how\n45 its feathers are distributed on its body and the\n46 existence of a uropygial gland close to the tail\n47 that secretes a hydrophobic liquid that is then\n48 spread over the puf\u0000n’s feathers and beak. Not\n49 only does this aid in the birds’ streamlined dives,\n50 but it also keeps them a\u0000oat while on the water\n51 for months at a time.\n52      Climate change has both helped and\n53 hindered the populations of Atlantic and Paci\u0000c\n54 Ocean puf\u0000ns. W hile warmer waters increase the\n55 amount of food available for puf\u0000ns to eat, other\n56 dangers occur due to \u0000uctuating weather and\n57 temperature patterns. In 2016 and 2017, it was\n58 observed by scientists that puf\u0000ns located on the\n59 coast of Alaska experienced a major die-off.\n60 W hile the exact reason for this tragedy remains\n61 elusive, climate change that ushers in \u0000uctuating\n62 ecosystems is most likely to blame. Even with\n63 these struggles, however, puf\u0000ns continue to\n64 survive and remain amusing, complex birds.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #4 v11.0 - RC\n21.  The main purpose of this passage is to\n(A)   compare puf\u0000ns and penguins.\n(B)   introduce the idea that eating raw\nanimals is very healthy for you.\n(C)   discuss general information about\npuf\u0000ns and how climate change has\naffected them.\n(D)   make an argument against the\nexistence of climate change and its\nimpact on animals.\n22.  W hy does the author refer to puf\u0000ns as\n“amusing” in line 64?\n(A)   Puf\u0000ns make funny sounds when they\nwalk.\n(B)   Puf\u0000ns have interesting plumage on\ntop of their heads that look like little\nhats.\n(C)   Puf\u0000ns tend to hop around on the\nground in a way that looks like dance\nmoves.\n(D)   Puf\u0000ns have inspired multiple funny\nnames based on their unusual\nappearance.\n23.  It can be inferred from the article that\npuf\u0000ns mostly eat\n(A)   seaweed.\n(B)   bugs they catch on the coastline.\n(C)   small sea creatures from the oceans.\n(D)   nuts and seeds they \u0000nd on the\ncoastline.24.  According to this passage, what does the\nuropygial gland do?\n(A)   It is used as part of the mating process\nof puf\u0000ns.\n(B)   It is a poison secreted when the puf\u0000n\nis in danger from a predator.\n(C)   It regulates the temperature of the\nbirds as they dive in freezing waters.\n(D)   It secretes a greasy liquid that, when\nspread over the puf\u0000ns’ feathers and\nbeak, makes them hydrophobic.\n25.  In line 61, \"elusive\" most nearly means\n(A)   astonishing.\n(B)   clear.\n(C)   mournful.\n(D)   puzzling.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 35 STOP.

There they found a young\n8 woman in long silk robes. She was\n9 surrounded by several helpers. Stopped at\n10 the edge of the river, she was waiting to step\n11 out of her carriage. Her followers were\n12 carrying so many of her many packages and\n13 possessions that they could not help her to\n14 cross the river. Rain had left the river waters\n15 high; the woman sat with her back straight\n16 and tall, impatient and speaking unkindly to\n17 those helping her.\n18       The younger of the two monks saw the\n19 woman and continued walking. However,\n20 the older monk, seeing her distress, lifted\n21 her up onto his shoulder. He carried her\n22 across the river and set her gently on the\n23 other side.\n24       The young woman, now safe on the\n25 Earth, simply turned away. She did not say a\n26 word of thanks to the older monk.27       The two monks, now both safely across\n28 the river, continued on their way.\n29       As they traveled, the younger monk\n30 barely noticed the sky or even the twisting\n31 dirt path in front of him. He was lost in\n32 thought, mulling over the encounter with\n33 the woman.\n34       Later in the afternoon, the older monk\n35 \u0000nally stopped; he could feel the younger\n36 monk’s stormy thoughts. He paused,\n37 breathing steadily in the falling sunlight.\n38 “Brother,” he said to the younger monk,\n39 \"what is wrong?\"\n40       The younger monk began, “That young\n41 woman was rude and ungrateful. Not only\n42 did she not thank you, but as monks, our\n43 spiritual tradition advises us to avoid\n44 touching women… yet you lifted her onto\n45 your shoulder and carried her. How could\n46 you break our vows and carry her?”\n47       The older monk gently replied,\n48 “Brother, I put her down by the river’s edge\n49 a long ways back.

The\n4 Mediterranean weather is so dry and hot in\n5 the direct summer sun, but in the breezy\n6 shade, the temperature is almost perfect.\n7       We took a road trip on our own through\n8 the countryside. Although we were able to\n9 pick up bits of words that sounded like the\n10 little Spanish we knew, Portuguese was\n11 different enough that we often asked for\n12 directions but then ended up getting further\n13 lost. However, the people we came across\n14 were so friendly and helpful; they acted out\n15 animated gestures, marking roads and\n16 roundabouts, speaking patiently and slowly,\n17 hoping we’d understand their deliberate\n18 words.\n19       As we journeyed, we came across acres\n20 and acres of farms terraced for grapes.21 Portugal is largely agricultural, and\n22 apparently wine is one of its largest\n23 industries. Walking through some of the\n24 grape \u0000elds, I was awed by the late\n25 afternoon light. The earth was a honey\n26 brown, and the grape leaves a fresh, almost\n27 electric green. One early evening, the sky\n28 was splashed with hot oranges and pinks;\n29 indigo blue storm clouds lifted to the right. I\n30 thought, “Ahh, this is what the\n31 Impressionists were painting.”\n32       We visited a lot of little towns on that\n33 road trip before ending up in Coimbra and\n34 Miranda. We passed streets and streets of\n35 white buildings with red clay tiled roofs.\n36 Almost every building front had chairs or\n37 benches where people simply sat and\n38 enjoyed life.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #4 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 11-15\n1      W hile most people in the United States wait\n2 until after Thanksgiving to put up Christmas\n3 decorations, the inhabitants of one Southeast\n4 Asian country eagerly await the “BER” months—\n5 September, October, November, and\n6 December—as those months of\u0000cially herald the\n7 Yuletide season. If you visit the Philippines in\n8 September, you will likely see decorators on\n9 scaffolding erecting giant Christmas trees and\n10 adorning buildings with garlands of lights. You\n11 will likely see many variations of the most\n12 popular and indicative Pasko (the Filipino name\n13 for Christmas) decoration - the parol.\n14      The parol is a \u0000ve pointed star lantern and its\n15 name is derived from the Spanish word “farol,”\n16 which means lantern or light. Indeed, before\n17 electricity came to the provinces, the parol was\n18 originally used to light the way from Filipinos’\n19 homes to the church mass. Then, instead of\n20 putting their lanterns away, Filipinos would hang\n21 the parols in front of their houses. Eventually,\n22 these star-shaped lanterns became the iconic\n23 Pasko symbol of Christmas in the Philippines.\n24      According to Philippine history, the \u0000rst\n25 parol was crafted in 1908 by Francisco\n26 Estanislao. The original parol was very simple –27 the frame was made from bamboo and covered\n28 with Japanese paper, which is translucent. Inside,\n29 there was enough room to place a candle. Before\n30 long, making parols for the Advent season\n31 became a tradition for many Filipino families,\n32 and the parol itself came to symbolize the Star of\n33 Bethlehem lighting the way for the Three Wise\n34 Men, much like the lantern would light the way\n35 for the Filipino villagers. These days the parol is\n36 no longer necessary as a means of illumination,\n37 and with the advancements in technology, the\n38 candlelit star lantern has evolved into a\n39 brilliantly \u0000ashing LED spectacle.\n40      In fact, these spectacular parols have\n41 inspired their own celebration known as the\n42 Giant Lantern Festival. The festival takes place\n43 in Pampanga, a province of Luzon. This\n44 event is celebrated on the Saturday preceding\n45 Christmas, and craftsmen from all over the\n46 country compete to win the trophy for the most\n47 beautiful lantern. Although there can only be one\n48 crowned winner, the true prize is won by the\n49 spectators who have the opportunity to wonder at\n50 all the illuminated works of art.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. ",

Turning off a major road\n3 onto a side street, I discovered something.\n4 Spread out under my car, painted right onto\n5 the pavement, was a huge, brightly colored\n6 dragon\u0000y. It covered the street from curb to\n7 curb, \u0000lling the entire intersection.\n8 Truthfully, I couldn’t tell what it was at \u0000rst.\n9 To determine its nature, I had to slow down\n10 and examine it carefully.\n11       Later, my friend explained this unusual\n12 neighborhood greeting. It is an example of\n13 traf\u0000c calming measures. These measures,\n14 common in Europe, include traf\u0000c circles,\n15 bicycle lanes, speed bumps, and more. To\n16 my mind, although they share the same\n17 purpose, painted pavement is potentially far18 more delightful than a speed bump.\n19       Busy cities in the U.S. are increasingly\n20 using such strategies to slow or space out\n21 vehicles and/or to increase safety. As you\n22 can imagine, a single “car calming” strategy\n23 often achieves more than one of these goals.\n24 I certainly slowed down in order to\n25 determine the subject of the painting and to\n26 enjoy it, and slowing down probably made\n27 my car less dangerous to pedestrians and\n28 bicyclists also using the intersection.\n29 However, I’m not sure this particular traf\u0000c\n30 calming measure reduces car volume. Now I\n31 always approach my friend’s home using\n32 this route just so I can re-visit that charming\n33 insect.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #4 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1      W hen you think about black and white\n2 birds that enjoy cold climates and dive into icy\n3 waters for their dinner, the \u0000rst animal to pop\n4 into your mind is probably the penguin.\n5 However, there is a lesser-known bird that shares\n6 many characteristics of a penguin yet is an\n7 entirely different bird altogether—the puf\u0000n.\n8 This interesting bird has black and white\n9 feathers, orange-red feet, and a brightly colored\n10 beak during the mating season that sheds and\n11 reveals a small, duller one underneath.\n12      Many consider the puf\u0000n to be quite the\n13 odd bird which is noted in its various namesakes.\n14 Puf\u0000ns are stocky with short wings, which\n15 relates to the English word “puf\u0000n,” meaning\n16 small and swollen. Its genus, Fratercula,\n17 comes from the Latin word for “little brother or\n18 friar,” as its black and white plumage looks\n19 strikingly like monks' robes. Finally, due to its\n20 distinctive coloring, the birds have also been\n21 referred to “clowns of the sea” and “sea parrots.”\n22      Even their stout, brightly colored appearance\n23 can’t save the puf\u0000n from its natural enemy—\n24 man. Puf\u0000ns reside in coastal areas in both the\n25 Atlantic and Paci\u0000c Ocean. Atlantic puf\u0000ns are\n26 hunted as part of Iceland’s normal diet. By using\n27 nets to catch the birds just before they dive into\n28 the water, \u0000shermen are capable of bringing\n29 down a few hundred birds in some hours’ time.\n30 Puf\u0000n meat is a popular menu item at Icelandic\n31 hotels, and the raw heart of a puf\u0000n makes for a\n32 macabre delicacy. Paci\u0000c puf\u0000ns reside in the\n33 North Paci\u0000c Ocean region, including34 Washington, British Columbia, Alaska, and\n35 Siberia.\n36      An interesting aspect of puf\u0000ns is how they\n37 can maneuver in the water. They are such strong\n38 ocean hunters that their dives are often referred\n39 to as underwater \u0000ight. Their wings work with\n40 their webbed feet to steer and propel themselves\n41 quickly through the water. It’s no surprise that\n42 puf\u0000ns are quite talented in the water as they\n43 spend about half of their lives there. They even\n44 have waterproof plumage, which is due to how\n45 its feathers are distributed on its body and the\n46 existence of a uropygial gland close to the tail\n47 that secretes a hydrophobic liquid that is then\n48 spread over the puf\u0000n’s feathers and beak. Not\n49 only does this aid in the birds’ streamlined dives,\n50 but it also keeps them a\u0000oat while on the water\n51 for months at a time.\n52      Climate change has both helped and\n53 hindered the populations of Atlantic and Paci\u0000c\n54 Ocean puf\u0000ns. W hile warmer waters increase the\n55 amount of food available for puf\u0000ns to eat, other\n56 dangers occur due to \u0000uctuating weather and\n57 temperature patterns. In 2016 and 2017, it was\n58 observed by scientists that puf\u0000ns located on the\n59 coast of Alaska experienced a major die-off.\n60 W hile the exact reason for this tragedy remains\n61 elusive, climate change that ushers in \u0000uctuating\n62 ecosystems is most likely to blame. Even with\n63 these struggles, however, puf\u0000ns continue to\n64 survive and remain amusing, complex birds.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. ",
