The ornithorhyncus\n7 anatinus (the scienti\u0000c name of the\n8 platypus) possesses many unique characteristics\n9 and belongs to a category of animals called\n10 monotremes.\n11      The platypus is unique among mammals as\n12 instead of giving birth to live young, it lays eggs\n13 from which its offspring hatch. The female lays her\n14 eggs in an underground burrow near the edge of\n15 the water, and, after about 10 days, the babies\n16 hatch. The mother platypus nurses her babies on\n17 milk from her mammary glands, and after four\n18 months the baby platypuses are grown enough to\n19 forage for their own food.\n20      Another unusual characteristic is that the\n21 platypus is one of only three classes of venom\n22 producing mammals in the world. Males possess\n23 venom producing spurs on their hind legs.\n24 Scientists believe that males use these primarily\n25 to ward off other males during mating season and\n26 secondarily as a defense mechanism against\n27 other predatory animals. W hile platypus venom\n28 can be dangerous for small animals, it is not lethal29 to humans.\n30      But, perhaps the most distinguishing feature of\n31 the platypus, its “duck bill”, is also its most\n32 extraordinary. This “duck bill” is equipped with\n33 about 40,000 electroreceptors that the platypus\n34 uses to detect its prey. The platypus submerges\n35 itself in the Australian rivers which it inhabits and\n36 moves its head side to side, using the\n37 electroreceptors in its bill to locate the worms,\n38 crustaceans, and other small animals that it likes\n39 to eat. The platypus has no teeth - so how does it\n40 eat? Once it has caught its prey, the “catch” is\n41 stored in its cheek pouches and mashed down\n42 with the gravel and small stones swallowed up\n43 with the platypus’ dinner.\n44      This hodge-podge of platypus traits is also\n45 con\u0000rmed in its genetic pro\u0000le. Scientists have\n46 sequenced the DNA of a female platypus and\n47 found that she shares 82% of her genome with the\n48 genomes of a human, mouse, dog, opossum, and\n49 chicken. W hile it may seem like the platypus is a\n50 haphazard blend of different animals, it actually\n51 signi\u0000es important events in evolutionary history,\n52 and its genome gives scientists more insight into\n53 how modern day mammals evolved from the\n54 dinosaurs that walked the Earth hundreds of\n55 millions of years ago.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 26 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\n1.  The main purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   explain why the platypus is\nendangered.\n(B)   analyze the hunting behavior of the\nplatypus.\n(C)   describe the attributes of an unusual\nmammal.\n(D)   urge scientists to learn more about\nthe platypus.\n2.  It can be inferred from the passage that\n(A)   the platypus is a herbivore.\n(B)   the platypus lives in the ocean.\n(C)   the platypus is not dangerous to other\nanimals.\n(D)   the platypus does not reproduce like\ntypical mammals.\n3.  The word “singular” in line 5 most nearly\nmeans\n(A)   aquatic.\n(B)   carnivorous.\n(C)   endangered.\n(D)   peculiar.\n4.  According to the passage, why does the\nplatypus use its venom?\n(A)   to stun its prey\n(B)   to frighten humans\n(C)   to attract other platypuses\n(D)   to discourage other male platypuses in\ncompetition for mates5.  According to the passage, the female\nplatypus’s genome\n(A)   can provide clues regarding\nmammalian evolution.\n(B)   closely resembles the genome\nof ducks and beavers.\n(C)   is remarkably different to the genome\nof other mammals.\n(D)   provides evidence of a direct\nevolutionary link to dinosaurs.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 27 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 6-10\n1      Music is an incredible part of the human\n2 experience. We hear music almost every single\n3 day of our lives, from the radio, commercials on\n4 TV, a neighbor’s sound system, or our siblings\n5 playing their school instruments. Some of us have\n6 even heard music in the months we spent inside\n7 our mother’s womb, hearing her humming,\n8 singing, or letting us listen to Mozart through\n9 headphones. Scientists now know that listening to\n10 music isn’t just something pleasant to do. It can\n11 make changes to our minds and bodies. The\n12 power of music can be harnessed to not just keep\n13 us entertained, but it can also help us in much\n14 deeper ways.\n15      One powerful thing music can achieve is\n16 connection. W hen Americans hear the National\n17 Anthem being sung before a football or baseball\n18 game, most take part in an over one-hundred-\n19 year-old tradition of putting their hands over their\n20 hearts, turning towards the American \u0000ag, and\n21 singing the words to the song. In those moments,\n22 Americans may all feel a part of the same group\n23 that has been brought together by a singular piece\n24 of music. Music can also create smaller, but just\n25 as important, connections between parents and\n26 children. W hen a parent sings a lullaby to their\n27 child before they go to sleep, the music creates an\n28 attachment between the parent and child. The\n29 parent feels good to be able to soothe their child\n30 to sleep and the child feels good because they are\n31 comforted by the parent. Connections created by\n32 music, either across hundreds of thousands of\n33 people or just two, bring us together.34      Music also has profound effects on learning. In\n35 one study, when students were promised music\n36 as a reward, their motivation to learn increased. In\n37 a different study, when students listened to\n38 classical music while memorizing, they\n39 memorized more than those that didn’t listen to\n40 music. In this same study, students were timed\n41 doing small tasks while listening to classical\n42 music and without any music. The group listening\n43 to music performed tasks faster. W hen\n44 researchers have performed scans of the brains of\n45 people listening to music, they found that our\n46 brains light up. Without music playing, our brains\n47 are not nearly as active.\n48      Music is not only a great resource to help students\n49 learn, but it is also a tool often used to aid in the\n50 treatment of mental illness. Scientists have found\n51 that listening to music releases chemicals in the\n52 brain that can help \u0000ght depression, reduce\n53 stress, increase immunity, and help us connect\n54 more easily with others. Music can be used to\n55 help reduce anxiety, especially music with\n56 calming rhythms, instruments, and beats. Even\n57 those suffering with chronic pain have found relief\n58 in focusing on music which helps steal the minds\n59 attention and keeps pain at bay.\n60      Music can be many things. It can be fun,\n61 enjoyable, loud, disruptive, healing, motivating,\n62 and even pain reducing. Without knowing music’s\n63 bene\u0000ts, it is still an important part of our lives\n64 and a part of what it means to be human.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\n6.  The main purpose of this passage is to\n(A)   list as many scienti\u0000c studies as\npossible that are about music.\n(B)   convince kids to take up instruments\nwhen they are young.\n(C)   prescribe listening to music as the\ncure for certain mental and body\nissues.\n(D)   illustrate why music is such an integral\npart of what it means to be human.\n7.  According to the study described in lines\n34–47, the students who did not listen to\nclassical music\n(A)   were able to memorize information\nfaster than students who listened to\nclassical music.\n(B)   were able to memorize information\njust as well as students who listened\nto classical music.\n(C)   were not able to concentrate as long\nas students who listened to any type\nof music.\n(D)   were not able to memorize\ninformation as well as the students\nwho listened to classical music.8.  Based on the passage, what can we infer is\nnot an example of music creating\nconnections with people?\n(A)   a school bus of kids singing “The\nW heels on the Bus\"\n(B)   a trumpet player practicing for their\nbig debut at Carnegie Hall\n(C)   an a capella group giving a concert on\nthe lawn of a school quad\n(D)   a grandmother and grandfather\ndancing to their wedding song on\ntheir 50th anniversary\n9.  In line 34, “profound” most nearly means\n(A)   bottom.\n(B)   great.\n(C)   interesting.\n(D)   wide.\n10.  According to the passage, what are three\nbene\u0000ts of music?\n(A)   Music is heard almost every single day,\nkeeps people entertained, and makes\nthe brain more active.\n(B)   Music connects groups of people,\nhelps people learn, and aids in the\ntreatment of certain illnesses.\n(C)   Music forms connections between\npeople, allows students to learn faster,\nand can increase a person's creativity.\n(D)   Music is enjoyed by people singing the\nNational Anthem, by babies hearing\nlullabies, and by students listening to\nmusic while studying.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 29 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 11-15\n1       Sometime in the near future, you’ll own a\n2 machine that creates all your favorite meals\n3 from just powder-\u0000lled cartridges. W hen you\n4 travel, you will \u0000y on a jet plane that is light,\n5 space-\u0000lled, and completely seamless. And, if\n6 you want a new pair of shoes, you’ll go to a\n7 store where they are created for you on the spot,\n8 according to your design. These stories may\n9 sound like science \u0000ction; however, thanks to\n10 3D printers, they may soon become plausible.\n11       3D printing is an additive manufacturing\n12 process, in which materials are layered on top of\n13 each other to create a three-dimensional object.\n14 Originally used by engineers to create\n15 prototypes, the technology has recently become\n16 more widely available. Now, you can buy a 3D\n17 printer for your own home to create small\n18 objects like a phone case or a bottle opener.\n19       Still, it’s the future potential of the\n20 technology that is most intriguing. In the\n21 medical \u0000eld, 3D printing labs are hard at work\n22 developing low-cost prosthetics, surgical tools,\n23 and custom medical implants. In 2012, a\n24 Belgian woman even received a 3D-printed\n25 titanium jaw bone, which was speci\u0000cally\n26 designed for her facial structure. In the future,27 researchers hope to learn how to create actual\n28 bodily organs, which could be used for\n29 transplants. Though this development is still\n30 unrealized, 3D printing has already improved\n31 the lives of countless patients.\n32       Engineers have also been experimenting\n33 with 3D printers across various manufacturing\n34 industries. Researchers in both aviation and\n35 aerospace are in the process of manufacturing\n36 light but strong rockets and jets, using enormous\n37 3D printers. And, in the world of automotive\n38 manufacturing, many large companies are\n39 already printing car parts, saving thousands of\n40 hours and thousands of dollars. A revolutionary,\n41 3D-printed electric car, called the LSEV, was\n42 unveiled in 2018—it takes just three days to\n43 manufacture from scratch!\n44       The possible applications of 3D printing are\n45 endlessly fascinating, ranging from housing and\n46 fashion to communication. Meanwhile, the\n47 speed and sophistication of 3D printers increase\n48 every year. New 3D printing technologies are\n49 constantly morphing, changing the world in\n50 ways that were unimaginable just a few years\n51 ago.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\n11.  The author’s attitude toward 3D printing is\n(A)   enthusiastic and curious.\n(B)   excited and worshipful.\n(C)   approving but cautious.\n(D)   hopeful but concerned.\n12.  From the passage we can infer that\n(A)   3D printing technology is widely\napplicable.\n(B)   3D printed cars are unlikely to become\npopular.\n(C)   3D printing works by cutting away\nfrom a large block of material.\n(D)   3D printers are as sophisticated now\nas they were 20 years ago.\n13.  W hat does the word “plausible” mean in line\n10?\n(A)   conceivable\n(B)   \u0000ctional\n(C)   genuine\n(D)   manufactured\n14.  W hich of the following do lines 16–18\nsuggest?\n(A)   3D printers are relatively expensive.\n(B)   3D printers are not meant for\nconsumer use.\n(C)   3D printing a jet plane in your own\nhome is unlikely.\n(D)   3D printing is only used by engineers\nand researchers.15.  According to the passage, 3D printing is\n(A)   no longer used by engineers to create\nmodels.\n(B)   adaptable to many different types of\nindustries.\n(C)   slower than traditional forms of\nmanufacturing.\n(D)   limited to certain materials: plastic,\ntitanium, and steel.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 31 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1       W hen we think of a mirror, we tend to\n2 think of a looking glass that we use for\n3 personal grooming or admiring ourselves. In\n4 addition to helping us check out our hair\n5 before we head out to school or work,\n6 mirrors are also a core element used in many\n7 technical tools, such as telescopes, lasers,\n8 cameras, and more. But how exactly do\n9 mirrors work? And what, exactly, are\n10 mirrors made of?\n11       W hen photons, or rays of light, coming\n12 from an object (your smiling face, for\n13 example) strike the smooth surface of a\n14 mirror, they bounce back at the same angle.\n15 Your eyes see these re\u0000ected photons as a\n16 mirror image. A mirror image means that the\n17 image is reversed, which you can easily see\n18 if you stand in front of a mirror with a shirt\n19 with words on it: the words on the shirt\n20 appear backwards in the mirror.\n21       So anything with a smooth surface that\n22 re\u0000ects almost all of the light that hits it\n23 (with only very little light absorbed or\n24 scattered) can function as a mirror. Rough\n25 surfaces scatter light instead of re\u0000ecting it.\n26 Of course, not all smooth surfaces act as27 mirrors. If a smooth surface absorbs the\n28 photons, they don’t bounce back and there\n29 will be no re\u0000ection.\n30       The very \u0000rst mirrors were probably\n31 calm, dark pools of water and rock or clay\n32 containers of water. Interestingly, from\n33 approximately 722 B.C. onward, the Chinese\n34 characters for mirror, known as jian and\n35 jing, are best translated as “a [large] tub\n36 \u0000lled with water.” The \u0000rst manufactured\n37 mirrors were likely polished stones, such as\n38 obsidian (a type of volcanic glass). Large\n39 pieces of polished metal, such as brass, were\n40 also used as mirrors, although these were\n41 very expensive.\n42       Today, mirrors are usually made of clear\n43 glass that has been coated on one side with a\n44 thin \u0000lm of metal, such as silver or\n45 aluminum. The mirrors in most bathrooms\n46 are these types of mirrors, known as plane\n47 mirrors. Plane mirrors are \u0000at and re\u0000ect the\n48 objects in front of them accurately,\n49 maintaining the same relative size and\n50 position of the objects re\u0000ected.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\n16.  The primary purpose of this passage is to\n(A)   describe some of the technical uses of\nmirrors.\n(B)   explain how mirrors are\nmanufactured.\n(C)   suggest that mirrors were \u0000rst\ninvented in China.\n(D)   describe some scienti\u0000c and historical\ninformation about mirrors.\n17.  The function of the \u0000rst paragraph (lines 1–\n10) is to\n(A)   describe two opposing viewpoints.\n(B)   introduce the passage's primary topic.\n(C)   relate an exciting personal anecdote.\n(D)   provide evidence to support the\nauthor's argument.\n18.  In line 6, “core” most nearly means\n(A)   main.\n(B)   manual.\n(C)   middle.\n(D)   minor.\n19.  According to the second paragraph (lines 11–\n20), when photons coming from an object\nhit a smooth surface,\n(A)   the light re\u0000ects back as a mirror\nimage.\n(B)   very few are absorbed and the light\nscatters.\n(C)   all the light is absorbed before it\nbounces back.\n(D)   the light re\u0000ects back at an opposite\nangle.20.  In line 48, “accurately” most nearly means\n(A)   exactly.\n(B)   polished.\n(C)   reasonably.\n(D)   reversed.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 33 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       Over 800 years old, Notre Dame is one\n2 of the largest and most well-known churches\n3 in the world. It is one of the most famous\n4 landmarks in France, and many people travel\n5 to see it every year. The church, or cathedral,\n6 is also an example of a style of architecture\n7 called Gothic architecture. Because it took over\n8 200 years to build Notre Dame, numerous\n9 changes over the years have resulted in a\n10 unique mix of styles, uniting centuries of art\n11 and architecture.\n12       The history of Notre Dame begins in\n13 1160, when Bishop Maurice de Sully had\n14 the previous Paris cathedral, Saint-Etienne,\n15 demolished to make way for this new\n16 place of worship. Construction began in\n17 1163 and the High Altar was of\u0000cially\n18 consecrated in 1182. As was typical of the\n19 time, the rapid completion of the eastern\n20 end of the church allowed people to use\n21 the space while the remaining structure\n22 slowly took shape. During this initial\n23 construction period, many architects worked\n24 on the project. They each put a unique,\n25 personal stamp on their respective parts of\n26 the church. These changes included\n27 remodeling sections of the main \u0000oor to \u0000t\n28 the latest style, and adding the famous rose\n29 window in strikingly elaborate stained glass.\n30 Construction on Notre Dame continued\n31 through 1345.\n32       W hile the cathedral was not originally\n33 designed with \u0000ying buttresses, which are\n34 arched exterior supports, ongoing construction\n35 led to a need for additional support. As\n36 the thin walls, widespread in Gothic\n37 architecture, were built higher, cracks\n38 formed as the walls bowed outward. The\n39 addition of \u0000ying buttresses allowed the\n40 cathedral to reach its impressive height of\n41 226 feet. In addition to these distinctive42 arches that adorn the exterior of the\n43 structure, Notre Dame is famous for its\n44 gargoyles, which serve both as decoration\n45 and as part of a functional system for\n46 rainwater run-off.\n47       During the French Revolution, many of\n48 the cathedral’s treasures were destroyed or\n49 looted. Statues were beheaded, windows\n50 were smashed, and the cathedral was used as\n51 a warehouse for storing food. In 1845, a\n52 controversial restoration program began,\n53 lasting 25 years and repairing some of the\n54 damage caused to the original structure. One\n55 of the architects, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc,\n56 took the opportunity to add his own touches\n57 to the building, including the addition of the\n58 chimeras now perched on the Galerie des\n59 Chimères. World War II caused even more\n60 damage to the building. Several of the\n61 stained glass windows were hit by stray\n62 bullets and needed to be refashioned after\n63 the war.\n64       In 1991, another restoration program\n65 was launched. Unlike previous restoration\n66 efforts, this program focused on repairing\n67 and cleaning the original architecture rather\n68 than adding to it, preserving this beautiful\n69 monument for generations to come.\nNote:\nIn April 2019, a massive \u0000re engulfed Notre\nDame as it was undergoing renovations. Though\nthe structure was saved from total destruction, the\ncathedral’s spire and part of its roof collapsed.\nFunds were quickly raised to restore the damage,\nwhich is currently planned to be completed within\n\u0000ve years.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #5 v11.0 - RC\n21.  W hich sentence best expresses the main\nidea of the passage?\n(A)   Notre Dame is a large tourist\nattraction in Paris.\n(B)   Modern restoration efforts are\nsuperior to older ones.\n(C)   Flying buttresses are an important\npart of cathedral architecture.\n(D)   Notre Dame’s structure includes many\ndifferent architectural styles.\n22.  The passage provides information to\nsupport which statement?\n(A)   Notre Dame is the most important\nchurch in the world.\n(B)   The Gothic period was the longest\narchitectural period.\n(C)   Cathedrals always have gargoyles\nprotecting their exteriors.\n(D)   Restoration efforts sometimes change\nthe original structure.\n23.  According to the passage, \u0000ying buttresses\nwere a necessary addition to the cathedral\nbecause\n(A)   they supported the unstable walls.\n(B)   they helped with rain water run-off.\n(C)   they were an important part of Gothic\ndesign.\n(D)   the arches made the exterior more\nvisually interesting.24.  The author would be most likely to disagree\nwith which of the following statements?\n(A)   The Gothic period is an important era\nin architecture.\n(B)   Notre Dame is an important historical\nlandmark.\n(C)   Restoration efforts should include\nwork to modernize the cathedral.\n(D)   Repair work over the centuries has\nchanged the appearance of the\ncathedral.\n25.  According to the passage, the many\narchitectural styles of the original building\nare indirectly due to\n(A)   the very long construction period.\n(B)   several architects’ dismissal for\ninferior work.\n(C)   the purchase of building materials\nfrom different places.\n(D)   Bishop de Sully changing his mind\nabout the design he wanted.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 35 STOP.

The ornithorhyncus\n7 anatinus (the scienti\u0000c name of the\n8 platypus) possesses many unique characteristics\n9 and belongs to a category of animals called\n10 monotremes.\n11      The platypus is unique among mammals as\n12 instead of giving birth to live young, it lays eggs\n13 from which its offspring hatch. The female lays her\n14 eggs in an underground burrow near the edge of\n15 the water, and, after about 10 days, the babies\n16 hatch. The mother platypus nurses her babies on\n17 milk from her mammary glands, and after four\n18 months the baby platypuses are grown enough to\n19 forage for their own food.\n20      Another unusual characteristic is that the\n21 platypus is one of only three classes of venom\n22 producing mammals in the world. Males possess\n23 venom producing spurs on their hind legs.\n24 Scientists believe that males use these primarily\n25 to ward off other males during mating season and\n26 secondarily as a defense mechanism against\n27 other predatory animals. W hile platypus venom\n28 can be dangerous for small animals, it is not lethal29 to humans.\n30      But, perhaps the most distinguishing feature of\n31 the platypus, its “duck bill”, is also its most\n32 extraordinary. This “duck bill” is equipped with\n33 about 40,000 electroreceptors that the platypus\n34 uses to detect its prey. The platypus submerges\n35 itself in the Australian rivers which it inhabits and\n36 moves its head side to side, using the\n37 electroreceptors in its bill to locate the worms,\n38 crustaceans, and other small animals that it likes\n39 to eat. The platypus has no teeth - so how does it\n40 eat? Once it has caught its prey, the “catch” is\n41 stored in its cheek pouches and mashed down\n42 with the gravel and small stones swallowed up\n43 with the platypus’ dinner.\n44      This hodge-podge of platypus traits is also\n45 con\u0000rmed in its genetic pro\u0000le. Scientists have\n46 sequenced the DNA of a female platypus and\n47 found that she shares 82% of her genome with the\n48 genomes of a human, mouse, dog, opossum, and\n49 chicken. W hile it may seem like the platypus is a\n50 haphazard blend of different animals, it actually\n51 signi\u0000es important events in evolutionary history,\n52 and its genome gives scientists more insight into\n53 how modern day mammals evolved from the\n54 dinosaurs that walked the Earth hundreds of\n55 millions of years ago.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 26 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #5 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 6-10\n1      Music is an incredible part of the human\n2 experience. We hear music almost every single\n3 day of our lives, from the radio, commercials on\n4 TV, a neighbor’s sound system, or our siblings\n5 playing their school instruments. Some of us have\n6 even heard music in the months we spent inside\n7 our mother’s womb, hearing her humming,\n8 singing, or letting us listen to Mozart through\n9 headphones. Scientists now know that listening to\n10 music isn’t just something pleasant to do. It can\n11 make changes to our minds and bodies. The\n12 power of music can be harnessed to not just keep\n13 us entertained, but it can also help us in much\n14 deeper ways.\n15      One powerful thing music can achieve is\n16 connection. W hen Americans hear the National\n17 Anthem being sung before a football or baseball\n18 game, most take part in an over one-hundred-\n19 year-old tradition of putting their hands over their\n20 hearts, turning towards the American \u0000ag, and\n21 singing the words to the song. In those moments,\n22 Americans may all feel a part of the same group\n23 that has been brought together by a singular piece\n24 of music. Music can also create smaller, but just\n25 as important, connections between parents and\n26 children. W hen a parent sings a lullaby to their\n27 child before they go to sleep, the music creates an\n28 attachment between the parent and child. The\n29 parent feels good to be able to soothe their child\n30 to sleep and the child feels good because they are\n31 comforted by the parent. Connections created by\n32 music, either across hundreds of thousands of\n33 people or just two, bring us together.34      Music also has profound effects on learning. In\n35 one study, when students were promised music\n36 as a reward, their motivation to learn increased. In\n37 a different study, when students listened to\n38 classical music while memorizing, they\n39 memorized more than those that didn’t listen to\n40 music. In this same study, students were timed\n41 doing small tasks while listening to classical\n42 music and without any music. The group listening\n43 to music performed tasks faster. W hen\n44 researchers have performed scans of the brains of\n45 people listening to music, they found that our\n46 brains light up. Without music playing, our brains\n47 are not nearly as active.\n48      Music is not only a great resource to help students\n49 learn, but it is also a tool often used to aid in the\n50 treatment of mental illness. Scientists have found\n51 that listening to music releases chemicals in the\n52 brain that can help \u0000ght depression, reduce\n53 stress, increase immunity, and help us connect\n54 more easily with others. Music can be used to\n55 help reduce anxiety, especially music with\n56 calming rhythms, instruments, and beats. Even\n57 those suffering with chronic pain have found relief\n58 in focusing on music which helps steal the minds\n59 attention and keeps pain at bay.\n60      Music can be many things. It can be fun,\n61 enjoyable, loud, disruptive, healing, motivating,\n62 and even pain reducing. Without knowing music’s\n63 bene\u0000ts, it is still an important part of our lives\n64 and a part of what it means to be human.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. ",

W hen you\n4 travel, you will \u0000y on a jet plane that is light,\n5 space-\u0000lled, and completely seamless. And, if\n6 you want a new pair of shoes, you’ll go to a\n7 store where they are created for you on the spot,\n8 according to your design. These stories may\n9 sound like science \u0000ction; however, thanks to\n10 3D printers, they may soon become plausible.\n11       3D printing is an additive manufacturing\n12 process, in which materials are layered on top of\n13 each other to create a three-dimensional object.\n14 Originally used by engineers to create\n15 prototypes, the technology has recently become\n16 more widely available. Now, you can buy a 3D\n17 printer for your own home to create small\n18 objects like a phone case or a bottle opener.\n19       Still, it’s the future potential of the\n20 technology that is most intriguing. In the\n21 medical \u0000eld, 3D printing labs are hard at work\n22 developing low-cost prosthetics, surgical tools,\n23 and custom medical implants. In 2012, a\n24 Belgian woman even received a 3D-printed\n25 titanium jaw bone, which was speci\u0000cally\n26 designed for her facial structure. In the future,27 researchers hope to learn how to create actual\n28 bodily organs, which could be used for\n29 transplants. Though this development is still\n30 unrealized, 3D printing has already improved\n31 the lives of countless patients.\n32       Engineers have also been experimenting\n33 with 3D printers across various manufacturing\n34 industries. Researchers in both aviation and\n35 aerospace are in the process of manufacturing\n36 light but strong rockets and jets, using enormous\n37 3D printers. And, in the world of automotive\n38 manufacturing, many large companies are\n39 already printing car parts, saving thousands of\n40 hours and thousands of dollars. A revolutionary,\n41 3D-printed electric car, called the LSEV, was\n42 unveiled in 2018—it takes just three days to\n43 manufacture from scratch!\n44       The possible applications of 3D printing are\n45 endlessly fascinating, ranging from housing and\n46 fashion to communication. Meanwhile, the\n47 speed and sophistication of 3D printers increase\n48 every year. New 3D printing technologies are\n49 constantly morphing, changing the world in\n50 ways that were unimaginable just a few years\n51 ago.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. ",

In\n4 addition to helping us check out our hair\n5 before we head out to school or work,\n6 mirrors are also a core element used in many\n7 technical tools, such as telescopes, lasers,\n8 cameras, and more. But how exactly do\n9 mirrors work? And what, exactly, are\n10 mirrors made of?\n11       W hen photons, or rays of light, coming\n12 from an object (your smiling face, for\n13 example) strike the smooth surface of a\n14 mirror, they bounce back at the same angle.\n15 Your eyes see these re\u0000ected photons as a\n16 mirror image. A mirror image means that the\n17 image is reversed, which you can easily see\n18 if you stand in front of a mirror with a shirt\n19 with words on it: the words on the shirt\n20 appear backwards in the mirror.\n21       So anything with a smooth surface that\n22 re\u0000ects almost all of the light that hits it\n23 (with only very little light absorbed or\n24 scattered) can function as a mirror. Rough\n25 surfaces scatter light instead of re\u0000ecting it.\n26 Of course, not all smooth surfaces act as27 mirrors. If a smooth surface absorbs the\n28 photons, they don’t bounce back and there\n29 will be no re\u0000ection.\n30       The very \u0000rst mirrors were probably\n31 calm, dark pools of water and rock or clay\n32 containers of water. Interestingly, from\n33 approximately 722 B.C. onward, the Chinese\n34 characters for mirror, known as jian and\n35 jing, are best translated as “a [large] tub\n36 \u0000lled with water.” The \u0000rst manufactured\n37 mirrors were likely polished stones, such as\n38 obsidian (a type of volcanic glass). Large\n39 pieces of polished metal, such as brass, were\n40 also used as mirrors, although these were\n41 very expensive.\n42       Today, mirrors are usually made of clear\n43 glass that has been coated on one side with a\n44 thin \u0000lm of metal, such as silver or\n45 aluminum. The mirrors in most bathrooms\n46 are these types of mirrors, known as plane\n47 mirrors. Plane mirrors are \u0000at and re\u0000ect the\n48 objects in front of them accurately,\n49 maintaining the same relative size and\n50 position of the objects re\u0000ected.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #5 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       Over 800 years old, Notre Dame is one\n2 of the largest and most well-known churches\n3 in the world. It is one of the most famous\n4 landmarks in France, and many people travel\n5 to see it every year. The church, or cathedral,\n6 is also an example of a style of architecture\n7 called Gothic architecture. Because it took over\n8 200 years to build Notre Dame, numerous\n9 changes over the years have resulted in a\n10 unique mix of styles, uniting centuries of art\n11 and architecture.\n12       The history of Notre Dame begins in\n13 1160, when Bishop Maurice de Sully had\n14 the previous Paris cathedral, Saint-Etienne,\n15 demolished to make way for this new\n16 place of worship. Construction began in\n17 1163 and the High Altar was of\u0000cially\n18 consecrated in 1182. As was typical of the\n19 time, the rapid completion of the eastern\n20 end of the church allowed people to use\n21 the space while the remaining structure\n22 slowly took shape. During this initial\n23 construction period, many architects worked\n24 on the project. They each put a unique,\n25 personal stamp on their respective parts of\n26 the church. These changes included\n27 remodeling sections of the main \u0000oor to \u0000t\n28 the latest style, and adding the famous rose\n29 window in strikingly elaborate stained glass.\n30 Construction on Notre Dame continued\n31 through 1345.\n32       W hile the cathedral was not originally\n33 designed with \u0000ying buttresses, which are\n34 arched exterior supports, ongoing construction\n35 led to a need for additional support. As\n36 the thin walls, widespread in Gothic\n37 architecture, were built higher, cracks\n38 formed as the walls bowed outward. The\n39 addition of \u0000ying buttresses allowed the\n40 cathedral to reach its impressive height of\n41 226 feet. In addition to these distinctive42 arches that adorn the exterior of the\n43 structure, Notre Dame is famous for its\n44 gargoyles, which serve both as decoration\n45 and as part of a functional system for\n46 rainwater run-off.\n47       During the French Revolution, many of\n48 the cathedral’s treasures were destroyed or\n49 looted. Statues were beheaded, windows\n50 were smashed, and the cathedral was used as\n51 a warehouse for storing food. In 1845, a\n52 controversial restoration program began,\n53 lasting 25 years and repairing some of the\n54 damage caused to the original structure. One\n55 of the architects, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc,\n56 took the opportunity to add his own touches\n57 to the building, including the addition of the\n58 chimeras now perched on the Galerie des\n59 Chimères. World War II caused even more\n60 damage to the building. Several of the\n61 stained glass windows were hit by stray\n62 bullets and needed to be refashioned after\n63 the war.\n64       In 1991, another restoration program\n65 was launched. Unlike previous restoration\n66 efforts, this program focused on repairing\n67 and cleaning the original architecture rather\n68 than adding to it, preserving this beautiful\n69 monument for generations to come.\nNote:\nIn April 2019, a massive \u0000re engulfed Notre\nDame as it was undergoing renovations. Though\nthe structure was saved from total destruction, the\ncathedral’s spire and part of its roof collapsed.\nFunds were quickly raised to restore the damage,\nwhich is currently planned to be completed within\n\u0000ve years.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. ",
