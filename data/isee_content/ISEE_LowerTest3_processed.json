If you create a new business and hire\n5 someone to make a logo for the company,\n6 would you prefer to choose among a few, a\n7 handful, or a database full of design options?\n8 If you are looking for a partner to\n9 spend your life with, how many potential\n10 suitors would you like to meet?\n11       Many people think that more choices\n12 result in a better decision and greater\n13 satisfaction. The more options you have, the\n14 better the dinner, logo, and life partner you\n15 end up with, right? The evidence is not so\n16 clear. It appears that the human mind does\n17 not necessarily work best with abundant\n18 options. There is a well-known study from\n19 2000 which helps illustrate some of the\n20 challenges that choice can present. The\n21 study examined how choice can affect\n22 people’s buying habits.\n23       Imagine you walk into a grocery store\n24 and come across a table displaying sealed\n25 bottles of jam and free samples. On one day,\n26 there are six different kinds of jam to choose\n27 from. However, on the following day, there\n28 are twenty-four different types of jam to29 sample. How many jams do people taste and\n30 how likely are they to purchase jam on these\n31 two different days?\n32       In this study, people sampled the same\n33 number of jams regardless of how many\n34 different types were for sale. However, the\n35 number of \u0000avors of jam on display strongly\n36 affected whether or not customers actually\n37 purchased jam. W hen there were six\n38 different types of jam to choose from,\n39 almost a third of the people who sampled the\n40 jam bought at least one jar. However, when\n41 there were twenty-four \u0000avors of jam to\n42 choose from, only three percent of people\n43 actually purchased jam. This means that\n44 about thirty people out of every hundred\n45 bought jam when there were only six\n46 choices, but only three people out of every\n47 hundred made a purchase when there were\n48 twenty-four choices.\n49       The human mind can become\n50 overwhelmed in the face of too many\n51 options. It appears that the more choices we\n52 have to consider, the less likely we may be\n53 to choose anything at all. We may just give\n54 up and walk away empty-handed.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 26 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #3 v11.0 - RC\n1.  The passage is primarily concerned with\ndescribing how\n(A)   people select different \u0000avors of jam.\n(B)   the number of available choices can\naffect human decision making.\n(C)   a greater number of options to choose\namong leads to increased satisfaction.\n(D)   people who are overwhelmed are\nhelped by other people making\ndecisions for them.\n2.  According to the author, the people\npresented with twenty-four types of jam\nwere less likely to purchase jam than the\npeople the day before because they\n(A)   chose to try the free samples.\n(B)   had been presented with too many\noptions.\n(C)   could not afford to buy all the \u0000avors\nthey liked.\n(D)   could not easily locate the jam they\nremembered liking.\n3.  The passage supplies information to answer\nwhich question?\n(A)   W hat is the ideal number of options to\nchoose among?\n(B)   Are people more likely to purchase a\nproduct they have sampled?\n(C)   How many options does it take to\noverwhelm the average human mind?\n(D)   Can the number of types of a single\nproduct affect whether people will buy\nthat product?4.  In line 17, “abundant” most nearly means\n(A)   appealing.\n(B)   challenging.\n(C)   plentiful.\n(D)   similar.\n5.  W hich can be inferred from the last\nparagraph (lines 49-54)?\n(A)   People are unlikely to purchase a\nproduct that has no competition.\n(B)   Studies on choice and human behavior\nare used to in\u0000uence consumers.\n(C)   Having fewer options to choose\namong can increase the likelihood that\npeople will make a choice.\n(D)   The human mind becomes easily\noverwhelmed when asked to sample\nmore than one type of jam.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 27 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #3 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 6-10\n1       Although many Americans take it for\n2 granted, “school lunch” is a relatively recent\n3 concept. In past centuries, few children\n4 other than those from upper-class\n5 families received a formal education.\n6 However, that fact changed in the 19th\n7 century. During the Industrial Revolution,\n8 many children began to work in factories\n9 instead of on farms. Writers and activists\n10 reacted to what they saw as an exploitation\n11 of child labor by arguing that childhood is a\n12 time of simplicity that should be\n13 safeguarded. In response to these protests,\n14 governments in Europe and North America\n15 \u0000rst passed child labor laws, then created\n16 programs for mandatory education.\n17       All children, not just the wealthy and\n18 aristocratic, now had to attend school. And,\n19 since children were spending most of their\n20 weekdays in a school building, they had to\n21 somehow be fed. In the United States, the\n22 \u0000rst school lunch programs were started by\n23 welfare organizations, whose goals were to\n24 provide all children, regardless of their\n25 economic status, nutritious food. During\n26 the Great Depression, the federal\n27 government began providing school lunch\n28 programs to American students by\n29 purchasing surplus food from farmers. For\n30 the next 50 years, federal funding and\n31 support remained in place.\n32       Throughout the 1980s and 1990s,\n33 however, there were many cuts to school\n34 lunch programs—nutrition standards\n35 became less of a priority than saving\n36 money. Famously, ketchup was declared a\n37 “vegetable” to avoid the expense of real\n38 vegetables. Signi\u0000cantly smaller lunch\n39 portions and poor nutrition standards even40 led Time magazine to state that American\n41 schools were “\u0000unking lunch.” Most often,\n42 these changes disproportionately impacted\n43 low-income children who could not afford\n44 to bring their own healthy lunches to\n45 school. During this same period, childhood\n46 obesity rates in the United States\n47 dramatically increased, also primarily\n48 among poorer children. Suddenly, school\n49 lunches became a key point in a nation-\n50 wide debate over how to help all children\n51 be healthy and happy.\n52       After decades of debate, Congress \u0000nally\n53 passed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in\n54 2010, which required the school meal\n55 programs to meet new nutrition standards.\n56 This piece of legislation was meant to\n57 return school lunches to the intentions of\n58 the original programs: to provide nutritious\n59 and satisfying meals to all children. Since\n60 the act passed, new nutrition standards\n61 have been established for school lunches.\n62 Now school lunches must include an\n63 increased portion of whole grains, fruits,\n64 and vegetables, while trans fats and sodium\n65 are restricted.\n66       Despite anecdotal reports that these\n67 healthier lunches are ending up in the trash,\n68 research suggests otherwise. A 2015 study,\n69 which followed 500 children in urban\n70 schools for two years, found a 19% increase\n71 in vegetable intake among the study’s\n72 subjects. These \u0000ndings should be\n73 encouraging to everyone invested in a\n74 common goal: ensuring that all children eat\n75 well and learn healthy eating habits, so they\n76 can grow physically and mentally strong.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #3 v11.0 - RC\n6.  The primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   describe the impact of the Healthy,\nHunger-Free Kids Act.\n(B)   explain why the obesity rate has\nincreased among American school\nchildren.\n(C)   describe the context and history of\nschool lunch programs in the United\nStates.\n(D)   discuss the advantages of developing\nhealthy eating habits from a young\nage.\n7.  In paragraph four (lines 53–66), the author\nof the passage\n(A)   emphasizes the importance of healthy\neating habits for adults.\n(B)   argues that some vegetables are\nhealthier than others.\n(C)   suggests that cuts to school lunch\nprograms affect primarily upper-class\nfamilies.\n(D)   describes some of the nutrition\nstandards that have been established\nfor school lunches.8.  In context, what conclusion can be drawn\nfrom the mention of the Industrial\nRevolution in the \u0000rst paragraph?\n(A)   The Industrial Revolution did not\naffect privileged, aristocratic families.\n(B)   The Industrial Revolution led to a rise\nin factories and a need for factory\nlabor.\n(C)   The Industrial Revolution was a major\ncause of the Great Depression.\n(D)   During the Industrial Revolution, food\nbecame much less healthy and\nnutritious.\n9.  In line 5, “formal” most nearly means\n(A)   ceremonial.\n(B)   lengthy.\n(C)   of\u0000cial.\n(D)   separate.\n10.  The purpose of the last sentence (lines 72–\n76) is to\n(A)   offer a simple solution that can help\nguide all future nutritional regulation.\n(B)   convince readers that a balanced diet\nis the most important part of a good\neducation.\n(C)   suggest that nutritious school meals\nare bene\u0000cial for physical and mental\nhealth.\n(D)   describe the results of the 2015 study\nand how it might in\u0000uence school\npolicies.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 29 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #3 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 11-15\n1       Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding\n2 Fathers of the United States, was an author,\n3 scientist, inventor, diplomat, and is the man\n4 on the $100 bill. But history has, for the\n5 most part, forgotten the women who shaped\n6 his life, including his favorite and youngest\n7 sister, Jane Franklin Mecom.\n8       Born six years after Ben, in 1712, Jane\n9 never went to school or learned to spell. But\n10 she loved reading and she loved books. We\n11 know this because she and her brother wrote\n12 to each other all their lives: they were each\n13 other’s dearest friend (Ben wrote more\n14 letters to Jane than to anyone else).\n15       Jane married at age 15, and at age 17\n16 she gave birth to the \u0000rst of her 12 children.\n17 In between children, Jane supported her\n18 family by turning her overcrowded four-\n19 room home into a boarding house. She also\n20 sewed bonnets, made her own soap, cooked,\n21 and cleaned.\n22       Ben’s letters are learned, warm, funny,\n23 and delightful; Jane’s are misspelled, fretful,24 and full of sorrow. “Nothing but troble can\n25 you her from me,” she warned. It’s\n26 extraordinary that Jane could write at all. “I\n27 have such a poor fackulty at making leters,”\n28 she confessed.\n29       Ben would have none of it. “Is there not\n30 a little affectation in your apology for the\n31 incorrectness of your writing?” he teased.\n32 “Perhaps it is rather \u0000shing for approval.\n33 You write better, in my opinion, than most\n34 American women.”\n35       Indeed, the fact that Jane could write at\n36 all is a skill that set her apart from most\n37 other women at that time. And it was big\n38 brother Ben who taught Jane to write. Ben\n39 also fueled Jane’s thirst for intellectual and\n40 political reading. She once asked him for a\n41 copy of “all the political pieces” he had ever\n42 written. “I could as easily make a collection\n43 for you of all the past parings of my nails,”\n44 he joked.

Its name comes from the diving\n4 bell: a large, open-bottomed chamber that traps\n5 air inside when dunked into the water. A person\n6 could \u0000t inside the diving bell, which was used\n7 for underwater exploration in the days before\n8 scuba tanks.\n9       The diving bell spider, which lives in the\n10 rivers and lakes of Europe and Northern Asia,\n11 uses a similar structure to survive underwater.\n12 First, it spins a dome-shaped web between\n13 underwater plants. Then, the spider surfaces and\n14 uses special hydrophobic hairs on its legs and\n15 abdomen to trap air bubbles. It carries these air\n16 bubbles down to the web and releases them\n17 inside, so that the dome in\u0000ates with air.\n18       This air bubble becomes its underwater\n19 home. From inside, the spider can plan hunting\n20 trips, lay eggs, rest, and eat. The silk web\n21 around the spider’s home, though waterproof,\n22 allows for gas exchange, and naturally sends\n23 carbon dioxide out of the bubble while bringing\n24 oxygen in from the surrounding water. This\n25 convenient arrangement allows the spider to\n26 breathe. However, the air bubble shrinks over\n27 time, and the spider can only stay inside for\n28 about a day before having to fetch new air.\n29 W hen it runs short on oxygen, it simply makes\n30 another trip to the surface to trap another air\n31 bubble.\n32       The mechanism of the spider’s web, which\n33 allows it to live and breathe underwater,34 essentially mimics that of a \u0000sh gill. In fact,\n35 scientists refer to it as a “physical gill”: one\n36 which is astonishingly ef\u0000cient. This “physical\n37 gill” can, through its walls, create up to eight\n38 times the amount of oxygen that the spider\n39 originally brought to \u0000ll it up.\n40       Due to the safety and comfort of the web,\n41 the diving bell spider spends as much time as\n42 possible inside, leaving only at night. In this\n43 way, it is able to avoid many would-be\n44 predators, including beetles, dragon\u0000y larvae,\n45 frogs, and \u0000sh. In the winter months, when its\n46 habitat ices over, the spider seals itself up inside\n47 the bell and stays there for months, until the\n48 surface thaws.\n49       In addition to its diving bell web, the spider\n50 has a second trick for breathing underwater: the\n51 water-repellent hairs on its body. W hen the\n52 spider swims, the air trapped in these hairs act\n53 as a “scuba skin,” allowing the spider to breathe\n54 while it hunts. The hairs also give the spider a silvery\n55 shimmer that led to its scienti\u0000c name:\n56 argyroneta aquatica, or “silver net in the water.”\n57       The water spider is an essential part of its\n58 habitat’s ecosystems, limiting the populations of\n59 mosquito larvae in low pH environments.\n60 Unfortunately, it is becoming rare in the\n61 marshes, lakes, and ponds where it once thrived\n62 across Europe and Asia. Hopefully, with\n63 increased research into the causes of its decline,\n64 this incredible, unique species will spread and\n65 thrive.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #3 v11.0 - RC\n16.  The \u0000rst paragraph (lines 1–8) suggests\nwhich of the following?\n(A)   The diving bell spider is exclusively\ncarnivorous.\n(B)   Diving bells are no longer widely used\nby divers.\n(C)   In captivity, the diving bell spider can\nlive up to twenty-four hours.\n(D)   Diving bells have replaced scuba tanks\nas a tool for underwater exploration.\n17.  This passage's tone is best described as\n(A)   impatient.\n(B)   informative.\n(C)   lighthearted.\n(D)   peaceful.\n18.  The word “fetch” in line 28 most nearly\nmeans\n(A)   collect.\n(B)   dispose.\n(C)   hydrate.\n(D)   scurry.\n19.  The primary purpose of the passage is to\n(A)   demonstrate the importance of\nscienti\u0000c research.\n(B)   introduce some characteristics of an\nunusual species.\n(C)   describe the value of even the smallest\nspecies of spider.\n(D)   urge readers to protect the diving bell\nspider from extinction.20.  W hich of the following conclusions can be\ndrawn from the third paragraph?\n(A)   The spider’s bubble runs out of oxygen\nafter about an hour.\n(B)   The diving bell spider raises its babies\noutside the air bubble.\n(C)   Too much carbon dioxide in the air\ncan make it dif\u0000cult to breathe.\n(D)   Humans based their diving bells off\nobservations of the spider’s structure.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 33 Go on to the next page. \n\nLower #3 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       There was once an old lady who worried\n2 all the time. Her elder son owned an\n3 umbrella shop while her younger son was a\n4 noodle vendor.\n5       On sunny days, the old lady thought,\n6 “Oh, no! The weather is so nice and sunny.\n7 No one is going to buy any umbrellas. W hat\n8 will happen if the shop has to be closed?”\n9 Such worrying made the old lady sad, and\n10 she couldn’t help but cry. Then, on rainy\n11 days, the old lady worried for her younger\n12 son. “My younger son is a noodle vendor,\n13 and he cannot dry noodles without the sun.\n14 W hat will he do if he has no noodles to sell?”\n15 So the old lady lived in sorrow every day.\n16 W hether sunny or rainy, she would fret for\n17 one of her sons. Even her neighbors could\n18 not console her and jokingly called her “the\n19 crying lady.”\n20       One day, the old lady met a hermit. He\n21 asked the old lady why she was always\n22 crying, and the old lady explained the23 problem to him. The hermit smiled kindly\n24 and said, “Madam! You need not worry. I\n25 will show you a way to happiness, and you\n26 will no longer feel the need to grieve.”\n27       The old lady immediately asked the\n28 hermit to show her what to do. The hermit\n29 replied, “It is very simple. You just need to\n30 change your perspective. On sunny days, do\n31 not think of your elder son not being able to\n32 sell umbrellas; rather, think of the younger\n33 son being able to dry his noodles. With such\n34 strong sunlight, he must be able to make\n35 plenty of noodles, and his business must be\n36 very good. On rainy days, think about your\n37 elder son’s umbrella store. With the rain, he\n38 must be selling a lot of umbrellas.”\n39       The old lady followed the man’s\n40 instruction. After a while, she did not cry\n41 anymore; instead, she smiled every day.

If you create a new business and hire\n5 someone to make a logo for the company,\n6 would you prefer to choose among a few, a\n7 handful, or a database full of design options?\n8 If you are looking for a partner to\n9 spend your life with, how many potential\n10 suitors would you like to meet?\n11       Many people think that more choices\n12 result in a better decision and greater\n13 satisfaction. The more options you have, the\n14 better the dinner, logo, and life partner you\n15 end up with, right? The evidence is not so\n16 clear. It appears that the human mind does\n17 not necessarily work best with abundant\n18 options. There is a well-known study from\n19 2000 which helps illustrate some of the\n20 challenges that choice can present. The\n21 study examined how choice can affect\n22 people’s buying habits.\n23       Imagine you walk into a grocery store\n24 and come across a table displaying sealed\n25 bottles of jam and free samples. On one day,\n26 there are six different kinds of jam to choose\n27 from. However, on the following day, there\n28 are twenty-four different types of jam to29 sample. How many jams do people taste and\n30 how likely are they to purchase jam on these\n31 two different days?\n32       In this study, people sampled the same\n33 number of jams regardless of how many\n34 different types were for sale. However, the\n35 number of \u0000avors of jam on display strongly\n36 affected whether or not customers actually\n37 purchased jam. W hen there were six\n38 different types of jam to choose from,\n39 almost a third of the people who sampled the\n40 jam bought at least one jar. However, when\n41 there were twenty-four \u0000avors of jam to\n42 choose from, only three percent of people\n43 actually purchased jam. This means that\n44 about thirty people out of every hundred\n45 bought jam when there were only six\n46 choices, but only three people out of every\n47 hundred made a purchase when there were\n48 twenty-four choices.\n49       The human mind can become\n50 overwhelmed in the face of too many\n51 options. It appears that the more choices we\n52 have to consider, the less likely we may be\n53 to choose anything at all. We may just give\n54 up and walk away empty-handed.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 26 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #3 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 6-10\n1       Although many Americans take it for\n2 granted, “school lunch” is a relatively recent\n3 concept. In past centuries, few children\n4 other than those from upper-class\n5 families received a formal education.\n6 However, that fact changed in the 19th\n7 century. During the Industrial Revolution,\n8 many children began to work in factories\n9 instead of on farms. Writers and activists\n10 reacted to what they saw as an exploitation\n11 of child labor by arguing that childhood is a\n12 time of simplicity that should be\n13 safeguarded. In response to these protests,\n14 governments in Europe and North America\n15 \u0000rst passed child labor laws, then created\n16 programs for mandatory education.\n17       All children, not just the wealthy and\n18 aristocratic, now had to attend school. And,\n19 since children were spending most of their\n20 weekdays in a school building, they had to\n21 somehow be fed. In the United States, the\n22 \u0000rst school lunch programs were started by\n23 welfare organizations, whose goals were to\n24 provide all children, regardless of their\n25 economic status, nutritious food. During\n26 the Great Depression, the federal\n27 government began providing school lunch\n28 programs to American students by\n29 purchasing surplus food from farmers. For\n30 the next 50 years, federal funding and\n31 support remained in place.\n32       Throughout the 1980s and 1990s,\n33 however, there were many cuts to school\n34 lunch programs—nutrition standards\n35 became less of a priority than saving\n36 money. Famously, ketchup was declared a\n37 “vegetable” to avoid the expense of real\n38 vegetables. Signi\u0000cantly smaller lunch\n39 portions and poor nutrition standards even40 led Time magazine to state that American\n41 schools were “\u0000unking lunch.” Most often,\n42 these changes disproportionately impacted\n43 low-income children who could not afford\n44 to bring their own healthy lunches to\n45 school. During this same period, childhood\n46 obesity rates in the United States\n47 dramatically increased, also primarily\n48 among poorer children. Suddenly, school\n49 lunches became a key point in a nation-\n50 wide debate over how to help all children\n51 be healthy and happy.\n52       After decades of debate, Congress \u0000nally\n53 passed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in\n54 2010, which required the school meal\n55 programs to meet new nutrition standards.\n56 This piece of legislation was meant to\n57 return school lunches to the intentions of\n58 the original programs: to provide nutritious\n59 and satisfying meals to all children. Since\n60 the act passed, new nutrition standards\n61 have been established for school lunches.\n62 Now school lunches must include an\n63 increased portion of whole grains, fruits,\n64 and vegetables, while trans fats and sodium\n65 are restricted.\n66       Despite anecdotal reports that these\n67 healthier lunches are ending up in the trash,\n68 research suggests otherwise. A 2015 study,\n69 which followed 500 children in urban\n70 schools for two years, found a 19% increase\n71 in vegetable intake among the study’s\n72 subjects. These \u0000ndings should be\n73 encouraging to everyone invested in a\n74 common goal: ensuring that all children eat\n75 well and learn healthy eating habits, so they\n76 can grow physically and mentally strong.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 28 Go on to the next page. ",

But history has, for the\n5 most part, forgotten the women who shaped\n6 his life, including his favorite and youngest\n7 sister, Jane Franklin Mecom.\n8       Born six years after Ben, in 1712, Jane\n9 never went to school or learned to spell. But\n10 she loved reading and she loved books. We\n11 know this because she and her brother wrote\n12 to each other all their lives: they were each\n13 other’s dearest friend (Ben wrote more\n14 letters to Jane than to anyone else).\n15       Jane married at age 15, and at age 17\n16 she gave birth to the \u0000rst of her 12 children.\n17 In between children, Jane supported her\n18 family by turning her overcrowded four-\n19 room home into a boarding house. She also\n20 sewed bonnets, made her own soap, cooked,\n21 and cleaned.\n22       Ben’s letters are learned, warm, funny,\n23 and delightful; Jane’s are misspelled, fretful,24 and full of sorrow. “Nothing but troble can\n25 you her from me,” she warned. It’s\n26 extraordinary that Jane could write at all. “I\n27 have such a poor fackulty at making leters,”\n28 she confessed.\n29       Ben would have none of it. “Is there not\n30 a little affectation in your apology for the\n31 incorrectness of your writing?” he teased.\n32 “Perhaps it is rather \u0000shing for approval.\n33 You write better, in my opinion, than most\n34 American women.”\n35       Indeed, the fact that Jane could write at\n36 all is a skill that set her apart from most\n37 other women at that time. And it was big\n38 brother Ben who taught Jane to write. Ben\n39 also fueled Jane’s thirst for intellectual and\n40 political reading. She once asked him for a\n41 copy of “all the political pieces” he had ever\n42 written. “I could as easily make a collection\n43 for you of all the past parings of my nails,”\n44 he joked. He sent what he could, and she\n45 read it all.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 30 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #3 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 16-20\n1       The diving bell spider is the only known\n2 species of spider that spends most of its life\n3 underwater. Its name comes from the diving\n4 bell: a large, open-bottomed chamber that traps\n5 air inside when dunked into the water. A person\n6 could \u0000t inside the diving bell, which was used\n7 for underwater exploration in the days before\n8 scuba tanks.\n9       The diving bell spider, which lives in the\n10 rivers and lakes of Europe and Northern Asia,\n11 uses a similar structure to survive underwater.\n12 First, it spins a dome-shaped web between\n13 underwater plants. Then, the spider surfaces and\n14 uses special hydrophobic hairs on its legs and\n15 abdomen to trap air bubbles. It carries these air\n16 bubbles down to the web and releases them\n17 inside, so that the dome in\u0000ates with air.\n18       This air bubble becomes its underwater\n19 home. From inside, the spider can plan hunting\n20 trips, lay eggs, rest, and eat. The silk web\n21 around the spider’s home, though waterproof,\n22 allows for gas exchange, and naturally sends\n23 carbon dioxide out of the bubble while bringing\n24 oxygen in from the surrounding water. This\n25 convenient arrangement allows the spider to\n26 breathe. However, the air bubble shrinks over\n27 time, and the spider can only stay inside for\n28 about a day before having to fetch new air.\n29 W hen it runs short on oxygen, it simply makes\n30 another trip to the surface to trap another air\n31 bubble.\n32       The mechanism of the spider’s web, which\n33 allows it to live and breathe underwater,34 essentially mimics that of a \u0000sh gill. In fact,\n35 scientists refer to it as a “physical gill”: one\n36 which is astonishingly ef\u0000cient. This “physical\n37 gill” can, through its walls, create up to eight\n38 times the amount of oxygen that the spider\n39 originally brought to \u0000ll it up.\n40       Due to the safety and comfort of the web,\n41 the diving bell spider spends as much time as\n42 possible inside, leaving only at night. In this\n43 way, it is able to avoid many would-be\n44 predators, including beetles, dragon\u0000y larvae,\n45 frogs, and \u0000sh. In the winter months, when its\n46 habitat ices over, the spider seals itself up inside\n47 the bell and stays there for months, until the\n48 surface thaws.\n49       In addition to its diving bell web, the spider\n50 has a second trick for breathing underwater: the\n51 water-repellent hairs on its body. W hen the\n52 spider swims, the air trapped in these hairs act\n53 as a “scuba skin,” allowing the spider to breathe\n54 while it hunts. The hairs also give the spider a silvery\n55 shimmer that led to its scienti\u0000c name:\n56 argyroneta aquatica, or “silver net in the water.”\n57       The water spider is an essential part of its\n58 habitat’s ecosystems, limiting the populations of\n59 mosquito larvae in low pH environments.\n60 Unfortunately, it is becoming rare in the\n61 marshes, lakes, and ponds where it once thrived\n62 across Europe and Asia. Hopefully, with\n63 increased research into the causes of its decline,\n64 this incredible, unique species will spread and\n65 thrive.\n© 2025 Test Innovators 32 Go on to the next page. ",

      "text": "Lower #3 v11.0 - RC\nQuestions 21-25\n1       There was once an old lady who worried\n2 all the time. Her elder son owned an\n3 umbrella shop while her younger son was a\n4 noodle vendor.\n5       On sunny days, the old lady thought,\n6 “Oh, no! The weather is so nice and sunny.\n7 No one is going to buy any umbrellas. W hat\n8 will happen if the shop has to be closed?”\n9 Such worrying made the old lady sad, and\n10 she couldn’t help but cry. Then, on rainy\n11 days, the old lady worried for her younger\n12 son. “My younger son is a noodle vendor,\n13 and he cannot dry noodles without the sun.\n14 W hat will he do if he has no noodles to sell?”\n15 So the old lady lived in sorrow every day.\n16 W hether sunny or rainy, she would fret for\n17 one of her sons. Even her neighbors could\n18 not console her and jokingly called her “the\n19 crying lady.”\n20       One day, the old lady met a hermit. He\n21 asked the old lady why she was always\n22 crying, and the old lady explained the23 problem to him. The hermit smiled kindly\n24 and said, “Madam! You need not worry. I\n25 will show you a way to happiness, and you\n26 will no longer feel the need to grieve.”\n27       The old lady immediately asked the\n28 hermit to show her what to do. The hermit\n29 replied, “It is very simple. You just need to\n30 change your perspective. On sunny days, do\n31 not think of your elder son not being able to\n32 sell umbrellas; rather, think of the younger\n33 son being able to dry his noodles. With such\n34 strong sunlight, he must be able to make\n35 plenty of noodles, and his business must be\n36 very good. On rainy days, think about your\n37 elder son’s umbrella store. With the rain, he\n38 must be selling a lot of umbrellas.”\n39       The old lady followed the man’s\n40 instruction. After a while, she did not cry\n41 anymore; instead, she smiled every day. And\n42 from that day on she was known as “the\n43 smiling lady.”\n© 2025 Test Innovators 34 Go on to the next page. ",
