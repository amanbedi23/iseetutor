Cats purr for lots of reasons! The most common one is that they're happy and content - like when you're petting them. But here's something super interesting: cats also purr when they're nervous or even hurt because the vibrations can help them feel better!

The purring sound comes from muscles in their throat that vibrate really fast - between 25 and 150 times per second! Some people think purring might even help heal their bones. Isn't that amazing?
