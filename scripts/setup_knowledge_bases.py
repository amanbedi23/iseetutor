Butterflies undergo a remarkable transformation called metamorphosis. This process has four distinct stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult butterfly.

The cycle begins when a female butterfly lays tiny eggs on a host plant. These eggs are often no bigger than a pinhead. After a few days, a tiny caterpillar emerges. The caterpillar's main job is to eat and grow. It munches on leaves constantly, growing so quickly that it must shed its skin several times.

When the caterpillar has grown enough, it forms a chrysalis. Inside this protective casing, an amazing transformation occurs. The caterpillar's body completely reorganizes itself into a butterfly. This process, called metamorphosis, takes about two weeks.

Finally, a beautiful butterfly emerges. Its wings are soft and crumpled at first, but they soon expand and harden. The adult butterfly will feed on nectar from flowers and eventually lay eggs to begin the cycle again.

Questions:
1. What are the four stages of butterfly metamorphosis?
2. What is the main purpose of the caterpillar stage?
3. How long does the transformation in the chrysalis typically take?
4. What do adult butterflies eat?""")
