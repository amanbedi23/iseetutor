- Sample questions with explanations
- Study tips and strategies
- Vocabulary lists with synonyms

### General Knowledge (`general_knowledge.db`)
- 13+ fun facts about animals, space, science, history, and geography
- Age-appropriate content for elementary and middle school
- Explanations to encourage curiosity

### Science Experiments (`science_facts.db`)
